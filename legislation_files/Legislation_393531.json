Transactions of a Market Maker should constitute a course of dealings reasonably calculated to contribute to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market, and Market Makers should not make bids or offers or enter into transactions that are inconsistent with such a course of dealings.

In the case of calls, parity is measured by the bid in the underlying security, and in the case of puts, parity is measured by the offer in the underlying security.</p><p>(2) The $0.25 amount above may be increased, or the provisions of this Rule may be waived, by the Exchange on a series-by-series basis.</p><p>(b) Appointment.

The Exchange may establish differences other than the above for one or more series or classes of options.</p><p>(i) The bid/offer differentials stated in subparagraph (b)(4) of this Rule shall not apply to in-the-money options series where the underlying securities market is wider than the differentials set forth above. For these series, the bid/ask differential may be as wide as the spread between the national best bid and offer in the underlying security.</p><p>(ii) The Exchange or its authorized agent may calculate bids and asks for various indices for the sole purpose of determining permissible bid/ask differentials on options on these indices. These values will be calculated by determining the weighted average of the bids and asks for the components of the corresponding index.

For in-the-money series in index options where the calculated bid/ask differential is wider than the applicable differential set out in subparagraph (b)(4) of this Rule, the bid/ask differential in the index options series may be as wide as the calculated bid/ask differential in the underlying index.

If a Competitive Market Maker initiates quoting in an options class, the Competitive Market Maker, associated with the same Member, is collectively required to provide two-sided quotations in 60% of the cumulative number of seconds, or such higher percentage as the Exchange may announce in advance, for which that Member&apos;s assigned options class is open for trading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Competitive Market Maker shall not be required to make two-sided markets pursuant to this this Rule in any Quarterly Options Series, any adjusted options series, and any option series with an expiration of nine months or greater for options on equities and exchange-traded funds (&#8220;ETFs&#8221;) or with an expiration of twelve months or greater for index options. Competitive Market Makers may choose to quote such series in addition to regular series in the options class, but such quotations will not be considered when determining whether a Competitive Market Maker has met the obligation contained in this paragraph.</p><p>(i) An adjusted options series is an options series wherein, as a result of a corporate action by the issuer of the underlying security, one option contract in the series represents the delivery of other than 100 shares of underlying stock or Exchange-Traded Fund Shares (&#8220;Adjusted Options Series&#8221;).</p><p>(ii) A Competitive Market Maker may be called upon by an Exchange official designated by the Board to submit a single quote or maintain intra-day quotes in one or more of the series of an options class to which the Competitive Market Maker is appointed whenever, in the judgment of such official, it is necessary to do so in the interest of fair and orderly markets.</p><p>(2) Primary Market Makers, associated with the same Member, are collectively required to provide two-sided quotations in 90% of the cumulative number of seconds, or such higher percentage as the Exchange may announce in advance, for which that Member&apos;s assigned options class is open for trading. Primary Market Makers shall be required to make two-sided markets pursuant to this Rule in any Quarterly Options Series, any Adjusted Options Series, and any option series with an expiration of nine months or greater for options on equities and ETFs or with an expiration of twelve months or greater for index options.</p><p>(3) Preferred CMMs, associated with the same Member, are collectively required to provide two-sided quotations in 90% of the cumulative number of seconds, or such higher percentage as the Exchange may announce in advance, for which that Member&apos;s assigned options class is open for trading. A Member shall be considered preferenced in an assigned options class once the Member receives a Preferenced Order in any option class in which they are assigned and shall be considered preferenced for that day in all series for that option class in which it received the Preferenced Order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Preferred CMM shall not be required to make two-sided markets pursuant to this Options 2, Section 4(e)(3) in any Quarterly Options Series, any Adjusted Options Series, and any options series with an expiration of nine months or greater for options on equities and ETFs or with an expiration of twelve months or greater for index options. Preferred CMMs may choose to quote such series in addition to regular series in the options class, but such quotations will not be considered when determining whether a Preferred CMM has met the obligation contained in this paragraph. A Preferred CMM may be preferenced in such series and receive enhanced allocations pursuant to Options 3, Section 10, Supplementary Material .03, only if it complies with the heightened 90% quoting requirement contained in this paragraph.</p><p>(4) Specifically, the Exchange will calculate subparagraphs (1) - (3) above by (i) taking the total number of seconds the Member disseminates quotes in each assigned options series, excluding, for Competitive Market Makers and Preferred CMMs, Quarterly Options Series, any Adjusted Options Series, and any option series with an expiration of nine months or greater for options on equities and ETFs or with an expiration of twelve months or greater for index options; and (ii) dividing that time by the eligible total number of seconds each assigned option series in the options class is open for trading that day. Quoting is not required in every assigned options series. Compliance with this requirement is determined by reviewing the aggregate of quoting in assigned options series for the Member.</p><p>(5) ISE Regulation may consider exceptions to the above-referenced requirement to quote based on demonstrated legal or regulatory requirements or other mitigating circumstances. For purposes of the Exchange&apos;s surveillance of Member compliance with this Rule, the Exchange will determine compliance on a monthly basis. The Exchange&apos;s monthly compliance evaluation of the quoting requirement does not relieve a Member of the obligation to provide two-sided quotes on a daily basis, nor will it prohibit the Exchange from taking disciplinary action against a Member for failing to meet the quoting obligation each trading day.</p><p>(6) If a technical failure or limitation of a System of the Exchange prevents a Marker Maker from maintaining, or prevents a Member from communicating to the Exchange, timely and accurate quotes, the Member shall promptly notify the Exchange and the duration of such failure or limitation shall not be included in any of the calculations under this subparagraph (e) with respect to the affected quotes.</p><p>(f) Temporary Withdrawal of Quotations by Primary Market Makers. A Primary Market Maker may apply to the Exchange to withdraw temporarily from its Primary Market Maker status in an options class. The Primary Market Maker must base its request on demonstrated legal or regulatory requirements that necessitate its temporary withdrawal, or provide the Exchange an opinion of counsel certifying that such legal or regulatory basis exists. The Exchange will act promptly on such a request, and, if the request is granted, the Exchange will temporarily reassign the options class to another Primary Market Maker.</p><p>(1) The Exchange Review Council shall have jurisdiction over proceedings brought by Primary Market Makers seeking review of the denial of an excused withdrawal pursuant to this Rule or the conditions imposed on their reentry.</p><p>[Adopted June 6, 2019 (SR-ISE-2019-17).]</p>","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":456805,"ParentPartSourceId":"283969ac-fd2f-fa38-dfa2-4536f0930481","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":393531,"LegislationSourceId":"da4047d0-c2a7-7152-d78f-8730e8178f10","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Nasdaq ise rules","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"c1b5f8c4-474a-4691-9d47-999dd90894ec","JurisdictionName":"United States of America","IssuingBodySourceId":"64fc69f7-e62e-46d2-a6f9-1d91d3c85d51","IssuingBodyName":"Nasdaq ISE","PartVersionId":456827,"PartSourceId":"5494161c-6315-892a-395f-ea6c467b57d9","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":7,"Content":"<p>(a) Options Classes to Which Appointed.

The calculation of Quality Opening Market is based on the best bid and offer of Valid Width Quotes. The differential between the best bid and offer are compared to reach this determination. The allowable differential, as determined by the Exchange, takes into account the type of security (for example, Penny Pilot versus non-Penny Pilot issue), volatility, option premium, and liquidity. The Quality Opening Market differential is intended to ensure the price at which the Exchange opens reflects current market conditions.</p><p>(8) A &#8220;Valid Width Quote&#8221; is a two-sided electronic quotation submitted by a Market Maker that meets the following requirements: differentials shall be no more than $.25 between the bid and offer for each options contract for which the bid is less than $2, no more than $.40 where the bid is at least $2 but does not exceed $5, no more than $.50 where the bid is more than $5 but does not exceed $10, no more than $.80 where the bid is more than $10 but does not exceed $20, and no more than $1 where the bid is $20 or greater, provided that, in the case of equity options, the bid/ask differentials stated above shall not apply to in-the-money series where the market for the underlying security is wider than the differentials set forth above. The bid/ask differentials for in-the-money options series may be as wide as the quotation for the underlying security on the primary market, or its decimal equivalent rounded down to the nearest minimum increment. The Exchange may establish differences other than the above for one or more series or classes of options.</p><p>(9) A &#8220;Zero Bid Market&#8221; is where the best bid for an options series is zero.</p><p>(b) Eligible interest during the Opening Process includes Valid Width Quotes, Opening Sweeps and orders.

The displayed and non-displayed portions of Reserve Orders are considered for execution and in determining the Opening Price throughout the Opening Process. Only Public Customer interest is routable during the Opening Process.</p><p>(1) Opening Sweep.</p><p>(i) A Market Maker assigned in a particular option may only submit an Opening Sweep if, at the time of entry of the Opening Sweep, that Market Maker has already submitted and maintains a Valid Width Quote. All Opening Sweeps in the affected series entered by a Market Maker will be cancelled immediately if that Market Maker fails to maintain a continuous quote with a Valid Width Quote in the affected series.</p><p>(ii) Opening Sweeps may be entered at any price with a minimum price variation applicable to the affected series, on either side of the market, at single or multiple price level(s), and may be cancelled and re-entered. A single Market Maker may enter multiple Opening Sweeps, with each Opening Sweep at a different price level. If a Market Maker submits multiple Opening Sweeps, the System will consider only the most recent Opening Sweep at each price level submitted by such Market Maker in determining the Opening Price.

The time period shall be no less than 100 milliseconds and no more than 5 seconds.</p><p>(3) The PMM assigned in a particular equity or index option must enter a Valid Width Quote, in 90% of their assigned series, not later than one minute following the dissemination of a quote or trade by the market for the underlying security or, in the case of index options, following the receipt of the opening price in the underlying index. The PMM assigned in a particular U.S. dollar-settled foreign currency option must enter a Valid Width Quote, in 90% of their assigned series, not later than one minute after the announced market opening. Provided an options series has not opened pursuant to Options 3, Section 8 (c)(1)(B) or (C), PMMs must promptly enter a Valid Width Quote in the remainder of their assigned series, which did not open within one minute following the dissemination of a quote or trade by the market for the underlying security or, in the case of index options, following the receipt of the opening price in the underlying index or, with respect to U.S. dollar-settled foreign currency options, following the announced market opening. Once an options series has opened pursuant to Options 3, Section 8(c)(1)(A) - (C), a PMM must submit intra-day, two-sided quotes in such options series pursuant to Options 2, Section 5(e)(2).</p><p>(4) A CMM that submits a quote pursuant to this Rule in any option series when the PMM&apos;s quote has not been submitted shall be required, once an options series has opened, to submit intra-day, two-sided quotes in such option series pursuant to Options 2, Section 5(e)(1).</p><p>(5) The Opening Process will stop and an option series will not open if the ABBO becomes crossed or when a Valid Width Quote(s) pursuant to Options 3, Section 8(c)(1) is no longer present. Once each of these conditions no longer exist, the Opening Process in the affected option series will start again pursuant to paragraphs (e) - (j) below.</p><p>(d) Reopening After a Trading Halt. The procedure described in this Rule will be used to reopen an option series after a trading halt. If there is a trading halt or pause in the underlying security, the Opening Process will start again irrespective of the specific times listed in paragraph (c)(1).</p><p>(e) Opening with a BBO (No Trade). If there are no opening quotes or orders that lock or cross each other and no routable orders locking or crossing the ABBO, the System will open with an opening quote by disseminating the Exchange&apos;s best bid and offer among quotes and orders (&#8220;BBO&#8221;) that exist in the System at that time, unless all three of the following conditions exist: (1) a Zero Bid Market; (2) no ABBO; and (3) no Quality Opening Market. If all three conditions exist, the Exchange will calculate an Opening Quote Range pursuant to paragraph (i) and conduct the Price Discovery Mechanism pursuant to paragraph (j) below.</p><p>(f) Pre-Market BBO Calculation. If there are opening Valid Width Quotes, or orders, that lock or cross each other, the System will calculate the Pre-Market BBO.</p><p>(g) Potential Opening Price. To calculate the Potential Opening Price, the System will take into consideration all Valid Width Quotes and orders (including Opening Sweeps and displayed and non-displayed portions of Reserve Orders) for the option series and identify the price at which the maximum number of contracts can trade (&#8220;maximum quantity criterion&#8221;). In addition, paragraphs (h)(3)(A) and (i)(5) - (7) below contain additional provisions related to Potential Opening Price.</p><p>(1) More Than One Potential Opening Price. When two or more Potential Opening Prices would satisfy the maximum quantity criterion and leave no contracts unexecuted, the System takes the highest and lowest of those prices and takes the mid-point; if such mid-point is not expressed as a permitted minimum price variation, it will be rounded to the minimum price variation that is closest to the closing price for the affected series from the immediately prior trading session. If there is no closing price from the immediately prior trading session, the System will round up to the minimum price variation to determine the Opening Price.</p><p>(2) If two or more Potential Opening Prices for the affected series would satisfy the maximum quantity criterion and leave contracts unexecuted, the Opening Price will be either the lowest executable bid or highest executable offer of the largest sized side.</p><p>(3) The Potential Opening Price calculation is bounded by the better away market price that may not be satisfied with the Exchange routable interest.</p><p>(h) Opening with Trade. The Exchange will open the option series for trading with a trade on Exchange interest only at the Opening Price, if any of these conditions occur:</p><p>(1) the Potential Opening Price is at or within the best of the Pre-Market BBO and the ABBO;</p><p>(2) the Potential Opening Price is at or within the non-zero bid ABBO if the Pre-Market BBO is crossed; or</p><p>(3) where there is no ABBO, the Potential Opening Price is at or within the Pre-Market BBO which is also a Quality Opening Market.</p><p>(A) If there is more than one Potential Opening Price which meets the conditions set forth in paragraphs (1) through (3) above where:</p><p>(i) no contracts would be left unexecuted and</p><p>(ii) any value used for the mid-point calculation (which is described in paragraph (g) above) would cross either:</p><p>a. the Pre-Market BBO, or</p><p>b. the ABBO, then, for the purposes of calculating the midpoint the Exchange will use the better of the Pre-Market BBO or ABBO as a boundary price and will open the option series for trading with an execution at the resulting Potential Opening Price. If these conditions are not met, an Opening Quote Range will be calculated pursuant to paragraph (i) below and thereafter, the Price Discovery Mechanism in paragraph (j) below will commence.</p><p>(i) The System will calculate an Opening Quote Range (&#8220;OQR&#8221;) for a particular option series that will be utilized in the Price Discovery Mechanism described below, if the Exchange has not opened subject to any of the provisions above.</p><p>(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4) below, to determine the minimum value for the OQR, an amount, as defined in a table to be determined by the Exchange, will be subtracted from the highest quote bid among Valid Width Quotes on the Exchange and on the away market(s), if any.</p><p>(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4) below, to determine the maximum value for the OQR, an amount, as defined in a table to be determined by the Exchange, will be added to the lowest quote offer among Valid Width Quotes on the Exchange and on the away market(s), if any.</p><p>(3) If one or more away markets are disseminating a BBO that is not crossed, (the Opening Process will stop and an option series will not open if the ABBO becomes crossed pursuant to (c)(5)) and there are Valid Width Quotes on the Exchange that are executable against each other or the ABBO:</p><p>(A) The minimum value for the OQR will be the highest away bid.</p><p>(B) The maximum value for the OQR will be the lowest away offer.</p><p>(4) If there are Valid Width Quotes on the Exchange that are executable against each other, and there is no away market disseminating a BBO in the affected option series:</p><p>(A) The minimum value for the OQR will be the lowest quote bid among Valid Width Quotes on the Exchange.</p><p>(B) The maximum value for the OQR will be the highest quote offer among Valid Width Quotes on the Exchange.</p><p>(5) If there is more than one Potential Opening Price possible where no contracts would be left unexecuted, any price used for the mid-point calculation (which is described in paragraph (g)(1) above) that is wider than the OQR will be restricted to the OQR price on that side of the market for the purposes of the mid-point calculation.</p><p>(6) If there is more than one Potential Opening Price possible where no contracts would be left unexecuted, pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) above when contracts will be routed, the System will use the away market price as the Potential Opening Price.</p><p>(7) If the Exchange determines that non-routable interest can execute the maximum number of contracts against Exchange interest, after routable interest has been determined by the System to satisfy the away market, then the Potential Opening Price is the price at which the maximum number of contracts can execute, excluding the interest which will be routed to an away market, which may be executed on the Exchange as described in paragraph (g) above. The System will route Public Customer interest in price/time priority to satisfy the away market.</p><p>(j) Price Discovery Mechanism. If the Exchange has not opened pursuant to paragraphs (e) or (h) above, after the OQR calculation in paragraph (i), the Exchange will conduct the following Price Discovery Mechanism.</p><p>(1) First, the System will broadcast an Imbalance Message for the affected series (which includes the symbol, side of the imbalance (unmatched contracts), size of matched contracts, size of the imbalance, and Potential Opening Price bounded by the Pre-Market BBO) to participants, and begin an &#8220;Imbalance Timer,&#8221; not to exceed three seconds. The Imbalance Timer will be for the same number of seconds for all options traded on the Exchange. Each Imbalance Message is subject to an Imbalance Timer.</p><p>(2) Any new interest received by the System will update the Potential Opening Price. If during or at the end of the Imbalance Timer, the Opening Price is at or within the OQR, the Imbalance Timer will end and the System will open with a trade at the Opening Price if the executions consist of Exchange interest only without trading through the ABBO and without trading through the limit price(s) of interest within OQR which is unable to be fully executed at the Opening Price. If no new interest comes in during the Imbalance Timer and the Potential Opening Price is at or within OQR and does not trade through the ABBO, the Exchange will open with a trade at the end of the Imbalance Timer at the Potential Opening Price.</p><p>(3) Next, provided the option series has not opened pursuant to paragraph (j)(2) above, the System will:</p><p>(A) send a second Imbalance Message with a Potential Opening Price that is bounded by the OQR (and would not trade through the limit price(s) of interest within OQR which is unable to be fully executed at the Opening Price) and includes away market volume in the size of the imbalance to participants; and concurrently</p><p>(B) initiate a Route Timer, not to exceed one second. The Route Timer operates as a pause before an order is routed to an away market. If during the Route Timer, interest is received by the System which would allow the Opening Price to be within OQR without trading through away markets and without trading through the limit price(s) of interest within OQR which is unable to be fully executed at the Opening Price, the System will open with trades at the Opening Price and the Route Timer will simultaneously end. The System will monitor quotes received during the Route Timer period and make ongoing corresponding changes to the permitted OQR and Potential Opening Price to reflect them.</p><p>(C) If no trade occurred pursuant to (B) above, when the Route Timer expires, if the Potential Opening Price is within OQR (and would not trade through the limit price(s) of interest within OQR that is unable to be fully executed at the Opening Price), the System will determine if the total number of contracts displayed at better prices than the Exchange&apos;s Potential Opening Price on away markets (&#8220;better priced away contracts&#8221;) would satisfy the number of marketable contracts available on the Exchange. The Exchange will open the option series by routing and/or trading on the Exchange, pursuant to paragraphs (1)-(3) below.</p><p>(1) If the total number of better priced away contracts would satisfy the number of marketable contracts available on the Exchange on either the buy or sell side, the System will route all marketable contracts on the Exchange to such better priced away markets as an ISO designated as an Immediate-or-Cancel (&#8220;IOC&#8221;) order(s), and determine an opening BBO that reflects the interest remaining on the Exchange. The System will price any contracts routed to away markets at the Exchange&apos;s Opening Price; or</p><p>(2) If the total number of better priced away contracts would not satisfy the number of marketable contracts the Exchange has, the System will determine how many contracts it has available at the Exchange Opening Price. If the total number of better priced away contracts plus the number of contracts available at the Exchange Opening Price would satisfy the number of marketable contracts on the Exchange on either the buy or sell side, the System will contemporaneously route, based on price/time priority of routable interest, a number of contracts that will satisfy interest at away markets at prices better than the Opening Price and trade available contracts on the Exchange at the Exchange Opening Price. The System will price any contracts routed to away markets at the better of the Exchange Opening Price or the order&apos;s limit price pursuant to this sub-paragraph; or</p><p>(3) If the total number of better priced away contracts plus the number of contracts available at the Exchange Opening Price plus the contracts available at away markets at the Exchange Opening Price would satisfy the number of marketable contracts the Exchange has on either the buy or sell side, the System will contemporaneously route, based on price/time priority of routable interest, a number of contracts that will satisfy interest at away markets at prices better than the Exchange Opening Price (pricing any contracts routed to away markets at the better of the Exchange Opening Price or the order&apos;s limit price), trade available contracts on the Exchange at the Exchange Opening Price, and route a number of contracts that will satisfy interest at away markets at prices equal to the Exchange Opening Price.</p><p>(4) The System may send up to two additional Imbalance Messages (which may occur while the Route Timer is operating) bounded by OQR and reflecting away market interest in the volume. After the Route Timer has expired, the processes in paragraph (3) will repeat (except no new Route Timer will be initiated).</p><p>(5) Forced Opening. After all additional Imbalance Messages have occurred pursuant to paragraph (4) above, the System will open the series by executing as many contracts as possible by routing to away markets at prices better than the Exchange Opening Price for their disseminated size, trading available contracts on the Exchange at the Exchange Opening Price bounded by OQR (without trading through the limit price(s) of interest within OQR which is unable to be fully executed at the Opening Price), and routing contracts to away markets at prices equal to the Exchange Opening Price at their disseminated size. In this situation, the System will price any contracts routed to away markets at the better of the Exchange Opening Price or the order&apos;s limit price. Any unexecuted contracts from the imbalance not traded or routed will be cancelled back to the entering participant if they remain unexecuted and priced through the Opening Price, otherwise orders will remain in the Order Book.</p><p>(6) The System will execute orders at the Opening Price that have contingencies (such as, without limitation, Reserve Orders) and non-routable orders, such as a &#8220;Do-Not-Route&#8221; or &#8220;DNR&#8221; Orders, to the extent possible. The System will only route non-contingency Public Customer orders, except that only the full volume of Public Customer Reserve Orders may route.</p><p>(A) The System will cancel (i) any portion of a Do-Not-Route order that would otherwise have to be routed to the exchange(s) disseminating the ABBO for an opening to occur, or (ii) any order that is priced through the Opening Price will be cancelled. All other interest will be eligible for trading after opening.</p><p>(k) During the opening of the option series, where there is an execution possible, the System will give priority to Market Orders first, then to resting Limit Orders and quotes. The allocation provisions of Options 3, Section 10 and the Supplementary Material thereto apply with respect to other orders and quotes with the same price.</p><p>(l) Upon opening of the option series, regardless of an execution, the System disseminates the price and size of the Exchange&apos;s best bid and offer (BBO).</p><p>[Adopted June 6, 2019 (SR-ISE-2019-17); amended July 10, 2019 (SR-ISE-2019-20), operative August 9, 2019.]</p>","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":456803,"ParentPartSourceId":"dc3c8d4d-a40e-837e-c1c1-837f71b3c3de","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":393531,"LegislationSourceId":"da4047d0-c2a7-7152-d78f-8730e8178f10","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Nasdaq ise rules","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"c1b5f8c4-474a-4691-9d47-999dd90894ec","JurisdictionName":"United States of America","IssuingBodySourceId":"64fc69f7-e62e-46d2-a6f9-1d91d3c85d51","IssuingBodyName":"Nasdaq ISE","PartVersionId":4900366,"PartSourceId":"c87da068-2b47-7a70-4814-be575b4d3a82","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":10,"Content":"<p>(a) Halts.

Thereafter, Responses, quotes and Professional Orders at the facilitation price will participate in the execution of the facilitation order based upon the percentage of the total number of contracts available at the facilitation price that is represented by the size of the Response, Professional Order or quote.</p><p>(C) Upon entry of an order into the Facilitation Mechanism, the facilitating Electronic Access Member can elect to automatically match the price and size of orders, quotes and responses received during the exposure period up to a specified limit price or without specifying a limit price. In this case, the facilitating Electronic Access Member will be allocated its full size at each price point, or at each price point within its limit price is a limit is specified, until a price point is reached where the balance of the order can be fully executed. At such price point, the facilitating Member shall be allocated at least forty percent (40%) of the original size of the facilitation order, but only after Priority Customer interest at such price point. Thereafter, all other orders, Responses, and quotes at the price point will participate in the execution of the facilitation order based upon the percentage of the total number of contracts available at the facilitation price that is represented by the size of the order, Response or quote. An election to automatically match better prices cannot be cancelled or altered during the exposure period.</p><p>(D) If a trading halt is initiated after an order is entered into the Facilitation Mechanism, such auction will be automatically terminated without execution.</p><p>(c) Complex Facilitation Mechanism. Electronic Access Members may use the Facilitation Mechanism in sub-paragraph (b) above to execute block-size Complex Orders at a net price. Each options leg of a Complex Order entered into the Complex Facilitation Mechanism must meet the minimum contract size requirement. The Complex Facilitation Mechanism is a process by which an Electronic Access Member can execute a transaction wherein the Electronic Access Member seeks to facilitate a block-size Complex Order it represents as agent, and/or a transaction wherein the Electronic Access Member solicited interest to execute against a block-size Complex Order it represents as agent. Electronic Access Members must be willing to execute the entire size of Complex Orders entered into the Complex Facilitation Mechanism.</p><p>(1) Complex Orders entered into the Complex Facilitation Mechanism must be priced within the parameters described below. Complex Orders that do not meet these requirements are not eligible for the Complex Facilitation Mechanism and will be rejected.</p><p>(2) Complex Options Orders must be entered into the Complex Facilitation Mechanism at a price that is (A) equal to or better than the best bid or offer on the Complex Order Book on the same side of the market as the Agency Order; and (B) equal to or better than the best net price achievable from the best ISE bids and offers for the individual legs on the same side of the market as the Agency Order; provided that, if there is a Priority Customer order on the best bid or offer for any leg, the order must be entered at an improved price consistent with Options 3, Section 14(c)(2).</p><p>(3) Stock-Option Orders and Stock-Complex Orders must be entered into the Complex Facilitation Mechanism at a price that is (A) equal to or better than the best bid or offer on the Complex Order Book on the same side of the market as the Agency Order; and (B) equal to or better than the best net price achievable from the best ISE bids and offers for the individual legs on both sides of the market; provided that, if there is a Priority Customer order on the best bid or offer for any leg, the order must be entered at an improved price consistent with Options 3, Section 14(c)(2).</p><p>(4) A Complex Order entered into the Complex Facilitation Mechanism will be rejected if any component of the Complex Order has not opened for trading, or if there is a trading halt in any series underlying the Complex Order. If a trading halt is initiated after the order is entered into the Complex Facilitation Mechanism, such auction will be automatically terminated without execution.</p><p>(5) Upon the entry of a Complex Order into the Complex Facilitation Mechanism, a broadcast message that includes the net price, side and size of the Agency Complex Order will be sent and Members will be given an opportunity to enter Responses with the net prices and sizes at which they want to participate in the facilitation of the Agency Complex Order. The time given to Members to enter Responses shall be designated by the Exchange via Options Trader Alert, but will be no less than 100 milliseconds and no more than 1 second.</p><p>(6) Responses are only executable against the Complex Order with respect to which they are entered, and will only be considered up to the size of the Complex Order to be facilitated. Responses must be entered in the increments provided in Options 3, Section 14(c)(1) at the facilitation price or at a price that is at least one cent better for the Agency Order.</p><p>(7) Responses submitted by Members shall not be visible to other auction participants during the exposure period and can be modified or deleted before the exposure period has ended. At the end of the period given for the entry of Responses, the facilitation order will be automatically executed.</p><p>(A) Unless there is sufficient size to execute the entire facilitation order at a better net price, Priority Customer Complex Orders and Responses to buy (sell) at the time the facilitation order is executed that are priced higher (lower) than the facilitation price will be executed at the facilitation price. Professional Complex Orders and Responses to buy (sell) at the time the facilitation order is executed that are priced higher (lower) than the facilitation price will be executed at their stated price, thereby providing the Complex Order being facilitated a better price for the number of contracts associated with such higher bids (lower offers).</p><p>(B) The facilitating Electronic Access Member will execute at least forty percent (40%) (or such lower percentage requested by the Member) of the original size of the facilitation order, but only after better-priced Responses, Complex Orders, as well as Priority Customer Complex Orders and Responses at the facilitation price, are executed in full. Thereafter, Professional Complex Orders and Responses at the facilitation price will participate in the execution of the facilitation order based upon the percentage of the total number of contracts available at the facilitation price that is represented by the size of the Professional Complex Order or Response.</p><p>(C) Upon entry of a Complex Order into the Complex Facilitation Mechanism, the facilitating Electronic Access Member can elect to automatically match the net price and size of Complex Orders, Responses received during the exposure period up to a specified limit price or without specifying a limit price. This election will also automatically match the net price available from the ISE best bids and offers on the individual legs for the full size of the order; provided that with notice to Members the Exchange may determine whether to offer this option only for Complex Options Orders, Stock-Option Orders, and/or Stock Complex Orders. If a Member elects to auto-match, the facilitating Electronic Access Member will be allocated its full size at each price point, or at each price point within its limit price if a limit is specified, until a price point is reached where the balance of the order can be fully executed. At such price point, the facilitating Member will be allocated at least forty percent (40%) (or such lower percentage requested by the Member) of the original size of the facilitation order, but only after Priority Customer Orders and Responses at such price point. Thereafter, Professional Complex Orders and Responses at the price point will participate in the execution of the facilitation order based upon the percentage of the total number of contracts available at the facilitation price that is represented by the size of the Professional Complex Order or Response. An election to automatically match better prices cannot be cancelled or altered during the exposure period.</p><p>(D) With respect to bids and offers for the individual legs of a Complex Order entered into the Complex Facilitation Mechanism, the priority rules applicable to the execution of Complex Orders contained in Options 3, Section 14(c)(2) will continue to be applicable and may prevent the execution of a Complex Order entered into the Facilitation Mechanism, in which case the transaction will be cancelled. If an improved net price for the Complex Order being executed can be achieved from Complex Orders, Responses on the Complex Order Book and, for Complex Options Orders, the ISE best bids and offers on the individual legs, the facilitation order will be executed against such interest.</p><p>(d) Solicited Order Mechanism. The Solicited Order Mechanism is a process by which an Electronic Access Member can attempt to execute orders of 500 or more contracts it represents as agent (the &#8220;Agency Order&#8221;) against contra orders that it solicited. Each order entered into the Solicited Order Mechanism shall be designated as all-or-none.</p><p>(1) Upon entry of both orders into the Solicited Order Mechanism at a proposed execution price, a broadcast message will be sent and Members will be given an opportunity to enter Responses with the prices and sizes at which they would be willing to participate in the execution of the Agency Order.</p><p>(2) At the end of the period given Members to enter Responses, the Agency Order will be automatically executed in full or cancelled.</p><p>(A) If at the time of execution there is insufficient size to execute the entire Agency Order at an improved price (or prices), the Agency Order will be executed against the solicited order at the proposed execution price so long as, at the time of execution: (A) the execution price is equal to or better than the best bid or offer on the Nasdaq ISE, and (B) there are no Priority Customer Orders on the Exchange that are priced equal to the proposed execution price. If there are Priority Customer Orders on the Exchange on the opposite side of the Agency Order at the proposed execution price and there is sufficient size to execute the entire size of the Agency Order, the Agency Order will be executed against the bid or offer, and the solicited order will be cancelled. The aggregate size of all orders, quotes and Responses at the bid or offer will be used to determine whether the entire Agency Order can be executed. Both the solicited order and Agency Order will be cancelled if an execution would take place at a price that is inferior to the best bid or offer on the Nasdaq ISE, or if there is a Priority Customer on the book at the proposed execution price but there is insufficient size on the Exchange to execute the entire Agency Order.</p><p>(B) If at the time of execution there is sufficient size to execute the entire Agency Order at an improved price (or prices), the Agency Order will be executed at the improved price(s), subject to the condition in (i)(A), and the solicited order will be cancelled. The aggregate size of all orders, quotes and Responses at each price will be used to determine whether the entire agency order can be executed at an improved price (or prices).</p><p>(C) When executing the Agency Order against the bid or offer in accordance with paragraph (i) above, or at an improved price in accordance with paragraph (ii) above, Priority Customer Orders will be executed first. Professional Orders and Market Maker quotes participate in the execution of the Agency Order based upon the percentage of the total number of contracts available at the best price that is represented by the size of the Professional Order or Market Maker quote.</p><p>(D) If a trading halt is initiated after an order is entered into the Solicited Order Mechanism, such auction will be automatically terminated without execution.</p><p>(3) Prior to entering Agency Orders into the Solicited Order Mechanism on behalf of a customer, EAMs must deliver to the customer a written notification informing the customer that its order may be executed using the Nasdaq ISE&apos;s Solicited Order Mechanism. Such written notification must disclose the terms and conditions contained in this Rule and must be in a form approved by the Exchange.</p><p>(e) Complex Solicited Order Mechanism. The Complex Solicited Order Mechanism is a process by which an Electronic Access Member can attempt to execute Complex Orders it represents as agent (the &#8220;Agency Complex Order&#8221;) against contra orders that it solicited according to sub-paragraph (d) above. Each Complex Order entered into the Solicited Order Mechanism shall be designated as all-or-none, and each options leg must meet the minimum contract size requirement contained in sub-paragraph (d) above.</p><p>(1) Complex Orders must be entered into the Complex Solicited Order Mechanism at a price that is (A) equal to or better than the best bid or offer on the Complex Order Book on both sides of the market; and (B) equal to or better than the best net price achievable from the best ISE bids and offers for the individual legs on both sides of the market; provided that, if there is a Priority Customer order on the best bid or offer for any leg, the order must be entered at an improved price consistent with Options 3, Section 14(c)(2). Complex Orders that do not meet these requirements are not eligible for the Complex Solicited Order Mechanism and will be rejected.</p><p>(2) A Complex Order entered into the Complex Solicited Order Mechanism will be rejected if any component of the Complex Order has not opened for trading, or if there is a trading halt in any series underlying the Complex Order. If a trading halt is initiated after the order is entered into the Complex Solicited Order Mechanism, such auction will be automatically terminated without execution.</p><p>(3) Upon entry of both orders into the Complex Solicited Order Mechanism at a proposed execution net price, a broadcast message that includes the net price, side and size of the Agency Complex Order will be sent and Members will be given an opportunity to enter Responses with the net prices and sizes at which they would be willing to participate in the execution of the Agency Complex Order. The time given to Members to enter Responses shall be designated by the Exchange via Options Trader Alert, but will be no less than 100 milliseconds and no more than 1 second. Responses are only executable against the Complex Order with respect to which they are entered, and will only be considered up to the size of the Agency Complex Order. Responses must be entered in the increments provided in Options 3, Section 14(c)(1) at the proposed execution net price or at a price that is at least one cent better for the Agency Order.</p><p>(4) Responses submitted by Members shall not be visible to other auction participants during the exposure period and can be modified or deleted before the exposure period has ended. At the end of the period given for the entry of Responses, the Agency Complex Order will be automatically executed in full pursuant to paragraphs (A) through (D) below, or cancelled.</p><p>(A) If at the time of execution there is insufficient size to execute the entire Agency Complex Order at an improved net price(s) pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(C) below, the Agency Complex Order will be executed against the solicited Complex Order at the proposed execution net price so long as, at the time of execution: (i) the execution net price is equal to or better than the best net price achievable from the best ISE bids and offers for the individual legs, (ii) the Complex Order can be executed in accordance with Options 3, Section 14(c)(2) with respect to the individual legs, (iii) the execution net price is equal to or better than the best bid or offer on the Complex Order Book, and (iv) there are no Priority Customer Complex Orders or Responses that are priced equal to the proposed execution price.</p><p>(B) If there are Priority Customer Complex Orders or Responses on the opposite side of the Agency Complex Order at the proposed execution net price and there is sufficient size to execute the entire size of the Agency Complex Order, the Agency Complex Order will be executed against such interest, and the solicited Complex Order will be cancelled, provided that: (i) the execution net price is equal to or better than the best net price achievable from the best ISE bids and offers for the individual legs, and (ii) the Complex Order can be executed in accordance with Options 3, Section 14(c)(2) with respect to the individual legs. The aggregate size of all Complex Orders, Responses and, for Complex Options Orders, the aggregate size available from the best bids and offers for the individual legs, will be used to determine whether the entire Agency Complex Order can be executed pursuant to this paragraph.</p><p>(C) If at the time of execution there is sufficient size to execute the entire Agency Complex Order at an improved net price(s), the Agency Complex Order will be executed at the improved net price(s), and the solicited Complex Order will be cancelled, provided that: (i) the execution net price is equal to or better than the best net price achievable from the best ISE bids and offers for the individual legs, and (ii) the Complex Order can be executed in accordance with Options 3, Section 14(c)(2) with respect to the individual legs. The aggregate size of all Complex Orders, Responses, and the aggregate size available from the best bids and offers for the individual legs for a Complex Options Order, will be used to determine whether the entire Agency Complex Order can be executed at an improved net price(s).</p><p>(D) When executing the Agency Complex Order against other interest in accordance with Options 3, Section 14(d)(2)(ii), Priority Customer Complex Orders and Responses will be executed first. Professional Complex Orders and Responses participate next in the execution of the Agency Complex Order based upon the percentage of the total number of contracts available at the best price that is represented by the size of the Professional Complex Order or Response. Finally, for Complex Options Orders, bids and offers for the individual legs will be executed pursuant to Options 3, Section 15 and the Supplementary Material thereto.</p><p>(5) Prior to entering Agency Orders into the Complex Solicited Order Mechanism on behalf of a customer, EAMs must deliver to the customer a written notification informing the customer that its order may be executed using Nasdaq ISE&apos;s Solicited Order Mechanism. Such written notification must disclose the terms and conditions contained in this Rule and must be in a form approved by the Exchange.</p><p>(f) Limitation on Concurrent Complex Strategy Auctions. Only one Exposure Auction at Supplementary Material .01 to Options 3, Section 14, Complex Price Improvement Mechanism auction at Options 3, Section 13(e), Complex Facilitation Mechanism auction at Options 3, Section 11(c), or Complex Solicited Order Mechanism auction at Options 3, Section 11(e), respectively, will be ongoing at any given time in a Complex Strategy, and such auctions will not queue or overlap in any manner. The Exchange will not initiate an Exposure Auction, Complex Price Improvement Mechanism auction, Complex Facilitation Mechanism auction, or Complex Solicited Order Mechanism auction in a Complex Strategy while another Exposure Auction, Complex Price Improvement Mechanism auction, Complex Facilitation Mechanism auction, or Complex Solicited Order Mechanism auction in that Complex Strategy is ongoing. If a Complex Price Improvement Mechanism auction, Complex Facilitation Mechanism auction, or Complex Solicited Order Mechanism auction for a Complex Strategy has been initiated, an Exposure Auction for that Complex Strategy will not be initiated, and an Exposure Only Complex Order for the Complex Strategy will be cancelled back to the Member. An Exposure Order for the Complex Strategy will be processed as an order that is not marked for price improvement.</p><p>(g) Concurrent Complex Order and single leg auctions. An auction in the Block Order Mechanism at Options 3, Section 11(a), Facilitation Mechanism at Options 3, Section 11(b), Solicited Order Mechanism at Options 3, Section 11(d), or Price Improvement Mechanism at Options 3, Section 13(d), respectively, or an exposure period as provided in Supplementary Material .02 to Options 5, Section 2, for an option series may occur concurrently with a Complex Order Exposure Auction at Supplementary Material .01 to Options 3, Section 14, Complex Facilitation Auction at Options 3, Section 11(c), Complex Solicited Order Auction at Options 3, Section 11(e), or Complex Price Improvement Mechanism auction at Options 11, Section 13(e), respectively, for a Complex Order that includes that series. To the extent that there are concurrent Complex Order and single leg auctions involving a specific option series, each auction will be processed sequentially based on the time the auction commenced. At the time an auction concludes, including when it concludes early, the auction will be processed pursuant to Options 3, Section 11(a), (b), (d), or Section 13(a) or Supplementary Material .02 to Options 5, Section 2, as applicable, for the single option, or pursuant to Supplementary Material .01 to Options 3, Section 14, Options 3, Section 11(c), 11(e), Options 3, Section 13(e), as applicable, for the Complex Order, except as provided for at Options 3, Section 13(e)(4)(vi).</p>","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":456803,"ParentPartSourceId":"dc3c8d4d-a40e-837e-c1c1-837f71b3c3de","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":393531,"LegislationSourceId":"da4047d0-c2a7-7152-d78f-8730e8178f10","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Nasdaq ise rules","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"c1b5f8c4-474a-4691-9d47-999dd90894ec","JurisdictionName":"United States of America","IssuingBodySourceId":"64fc69f7-e62e-46d2-a6f9-1d91d3c85d51","IssuingBodyName":"Nasdaq ISE","PartVersionId":456779,"PartSourceId":"bf2b2f4b-a42a-4c80-262c-3f4c48c6bfb6","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":15,"Content":"<p>.01 It will be a violation of a Member&apos;s duty of best execution to its customer if it were to cancel a facilitation order to avoid execution of the order at a better price.

Accordingly, while facilitation orders can be canceled during the time period given for the entry of Responses, if a Member were to cancel a facilitation order when there was a superior price available on the Exchange and subsequently re-enter the facilitation order at the same facilitation price after the better price was no longer available without attempting to obtain that better price for its customer, there would be a presumption that the Member did so to avoid execution of its customer order in whole or in part by other brokers at the better price.</p><p>.02 Responses represent non-firm interest that can be canceled at any time prior to execution.

This broadcast message will not be included in the Nasdaq ISE disseminated best bid or offer and will not be disseminated through OPRA.</p><p>(1) The Exchange will designate via an Options Trader Alert a time of no less than 100 milliseconds and no more than 1 second for Members to indicate the size and price at which they want to participate in the execution of the Agency Order (&#8220;Improvement Orders&#8221;).</p><p>(2) Improvement Orders may be entered by all Members in one-cent increments at the same price as the Crossing Transaction or at an improved price for the Agency Order, and for any size up to the size of the Agency Order.</p><p>(3) During the exposure period, Improvement Orders may not be canceled, but may be modified to (1) increase the size at the same price, or (2) improve the price of the Improvement Order for any size up to the size of the Agency Order.</p><p>(4) During the exposure period, responses (including the Counter-Side Order, Improvement Orders, and any changes to either) submitted by Members shall not be visible to other auction participants.</p><p>(5) The exposure period will automatically terminate (i) at the end of the time period designated by the Exchange pursuant to paragraph(c)(1) above, (ii) upon the receipt of a market or marketable limit order on the Exchange in the same series, or (iii) upon the receipt of a non-marketable limit order in the same series on the same side of the market as the Agency Order that would cause the price of the Crossing Transaction to be outside of the best bid or offer on the Exchange.</p><p>(d) Execution. At the end of the exposure period the Agency Order will be executed in full at the best prices available, taking into consideration orders and quotes in the Exchange market, Improvement Orders, and the Counter-Side Order. The Agency Order will receive executions at multiple price levels if there is insufficient size to execute the entire order at the best price.</p><p>(1) At a given price, &#8220;Priority Customer Interest&#8221; (Priority Customer Orders and Improvement Orders from Priority Customers) is executed in full before &#8220;Professional Interest&#8221; (Professional Orders, Improvement Orders from non-Priority Customers and Market Maker quotes).</p><p>(2) After Priority Customer Interest at a given price, Professional Interest will participate in the execution of the Agency Order based upon the percentage of the total number of contracts available at the price that is represented by the size of such interest.</p><p>(3) In the case where the Counter-Side Order is at the same price as Professional Interest in (d)(2), the Counter-Side order will be allocated the greater of one (1) contract or forty percent (40%) of the initial size of the Agency Order before Professional Interest is executed. Upon entry of Counter-Side orders, Members can elect to automatically match the price and size of orders, quotes and responses received during the exposure period up to a specified limit price or without specifying a limit price. In this case, the Counter-Side order will be allocated its full size at each price point, or at each price point within its limit price if a limit is specified, until a price point is reached where the balance of the order can be fully executed. At such price point, the Counter-Side order shall be allocated the greater of one contract or forty percent (40%) of the original size of the Agency Order, but only after Priority Customer Interest at such price point are executed in full. Thereafter, all Professional Interest at the price point will participate in the execution of the Agency Order based upon the percentage of the total number of contracts available at the price that is represented by the size of the Professional Interest. An election to automatically match better prices cannot be cancelled or altered during the exposure period.</p><p>(4) When a market order or marketable limit order on the opposite side of the market from the Agency Order ends the exposure period, it will participate in the execution of the Agency Order at the price that is mid-way between the best counter-side interest and the NBBO, so that both the market or marketable limit order and the Agency Order receive price improvement. Transactions will be rounded, when necessary, to the $.01 increment that favors the Agency Order.</p><p>(5) If a trading halt is initiated after an order is entered into the Price Improvement Mechanism, such auction will be automatically terminated without execution.</p><p>(e) Complex Price Improvement Mechanism. Electronic Access Members may use the Price Improvement Mechanism according to this Rule to execute Complex Orders at a net price. The Complex Price Improvement Mechanism is a process by which an Electronic Access Member can provide price improvement opportunities for a transaction wherein the Electronic Access Member seeks to facilitate a Complex Order it represents as agent, and/or a transaction wherein the Electronic Access Member solicited interest to execute against a Complex Order it represents as agent (a &#8220;Crossing Transaction&#8221;).</p><p>(1) Crossing Transaction Entry. A Crossing Transaction is comprised of the order the Electronic Access Member represents as agent (the &#8220;Agency Order&#8221;) and a counter-side order for the full size of the Agency Order (the &#8220;Counter-Side Order&#8221;). The Counter-Side Order may represent interest for the Member&apos;s own account, or interest the Member has solicited from one or more other parties, or a combination of both.</p><p>(2) Complex Orders must be entered into the Complex Price Improvement Mechanism at a price that is better than the best net price (i) available on the Complex Order Book on both sides of the market; and (ii) achievable from the best ISE bids and offers for the individual legs on both sides of the market (an &#8220;improved net price&#8221;). Complex Orders will be rejected unless they are entered at an improved net price.</p><p>(3) A Complex Order entered into the Complex Price Improvement Mechanism will be rejected if any component of the Complex Order has not opened for trading, or if there is a trading halt in any series underlying the Complex Order. If a trading halt is initiated after the order is entered into the Complex Price Improvement Mechanism, such auction will be automatically terminated without an execution.</p><p>(4) Exposure Period. Upon entry of a Complex Order into the Complex Price Improvement Mechanism, a broadcast message that includes the net price, side and size of the Agency Complex Order will be sent to Members.</p><p>(i) The Exchange will designate via Options Trader Alert a time of no less than 100 milliseconds and no more than 1 second for Members to indicate the size and net price at which they want to participate in the execution of the Agency Complex Order (&#8220;Improvement Complex Orders&#8221;). Improvement Complex Orders may be entered by all Members for their own account or for the account of a Public Customer. Improvement Complex Orders are only executable against the Complex Order with respect to which they are entered, and will only be considered up to the size of the Agency Complex Order. Improvement Complex Orders must be entered in the increments provided in Options 3, Section 14(c)(1) at the same price as the Crossing Transaction or at a price that is at least one cent better for the Agency Complex Order.</p><p>(ii) During the exposure period, Improvement Complex Orders may not be canceled, but may be modified to (1) increase the size at the same price, or (2) improve the price of the Improvement Complex Order for any size.</p><p>(iii) During the exposure period, responses (including the Counter-Side Order, Improvement Complex Orders, and any changes to either) submitted by Members shall not be visible to other auction participants.</p><p>(iv) The exposure period will automatically terminate (A) at the end of the time period designated by the Exchange pursuant to subparagraph (4)(i) above, (B) upon the receipt of a Complex Order in the same complex strategy on either side of the market that is marketable against the Complex Order Book or bids and offers for the individual legs, or (C) upon the receipt of a non-marketable Complex Order in the same complex strategy on the same side of the market as the Agency Complex Order that would cause the execution of the Agency Complex Order to be outside of the best bid or offer on the Complex Order Book.</p><p>(v) Pursuant to Supplementary Material .04 of this Rule, only one Complex Price Improvement Mechanism may be ongoing at any given time in a given complex strategy. However, a price improvement auction may be ongoing concurrently in series of individual legs of a complex strategy.</p><p>(vi) A Complex Price Improvement Mechanism in a complex strategy may be ongoing at the same time as a Price Improvement Auction pursuant to this Rule or during an exposure period pursuant to Supplementary Material .02 to Options 5, Section 2 in a component leg(s) of such Complex Order. If a Complex Price Improvement Mechanism is early terminated pursuant to paragraph (iv) above, and the incoming Complex Order that causes the early termination in the complex strategy is also marketable against a component leg(s) of the complex strategy that is the subject of a concurrent ongoing Price Improvement Auction pursuant to this Rule or an exposure period pursuant to Supplementary Material .02 to Options 5, Section 2, then the concurrent Complex Price Improvement Mechanism and component leg auction(s) are processed in the following sequence: (1) the Complex Price Improvement Mechanism is early terminated; (2) the component leg auction(s) are early terminated and processed; and (3) legging of residual incoming Complex Order interest occurs, except with respect to Stock Option Orders and Stock Complex Orders.</p><p>(5) Execution. At the end of the exposure period the Agency Complex Order will be executed in full at the best prices available, taking into consideration Complex Orders in the Complex Order Book, Improvement Complex Orders, the Counter-Side Order, and, for Complex Options Orders, the ISE best bids and offers on the individual legs. The Agency Complex Order will receive executions at multiple price levels if there is insufficient size to execute the entire order at the best price.</p><p>(i) At a given net price, Priority Customer interest on the Complex Order Book (i.e., Priority Customer Complex Orders and Improvement Complex Orders) is executed in full before Professional interest (i.e., Professional Complex Orders and Improvement Complex Orders) on the Complex Order Book.</p><p>(ii) After Priority Customer interest on the Complex Order Book at a given net price, Professional interest on the Complex Order Book will participate in the execution of the Agency Complex Order based upon the percentage of the total number of contracts available at the price that is represented by the size of such interest.</p><p>(iii) In the case where the Counter-Side Complex Order is at the same net price as Professional interest on the Complex Order Book in (ii) above, the Counter-Side Complex Order will be allocated the greater of one (1) contract or forty percent (40%) (or such lower percentage requested by the Member) of the initial size of the Agency Complex Order before other Professional interest on the Complex Order Book are executed. Upon entry of Counter-Side Complex Orders, Members can elect to automatically match the price and size of Complex Orders, Improvement Complex Orders received on the Complex Order Book during the exposure period up to a specified limit net price or without specifying a limit net price. This election will also automatically match the net price available from the ISE best bids and offers on the individual legs for the full size of the order; provided that with notice to Members the Exchange may determine whether to offer this option only for Complex Options Orders, Stock-Option Orders, and/or Stock Complex Orders. If a Member elects to auto-match, the Counter-Side Complex Order will be allocated its full size at each price point, or at each price point within its limit net price if a limit is specified, until a price point is reached where the balance of the order can be fully executed. At such price point, the Counter-Side Complex Order shall be allocated the greater of one contract or forty percent (40%) (or such lower percentage requested by the Member) of the original size of the Agency Complex Order, but only after Priority Customer Complex Orders and Improvement Complex Orders at such price point are executed in full. Thereafter, all Professional Complex Orders and Improvement Complex Orders at the price point will participate in the execution of the Agency Complex Order based upon the percentage of the total number of contracts available at the price that is represented by the size of the Professional Complex Order or Improvement Complex Order on the Complex Order Book.</p><p>(iv) When a marketable Complex Order on the opposite side of the Agency Complex Order ends the exposure period, it will participate in the execution of the Agency Complex Order at the price that is mid-way between the best counter-side interest and the same side best bid or offer on the Complex Order Book or net price from ISE best bid or offer on individual legs, whichever is better, so that both the marketable Complex Order and the Agency Complex Order receive price improvement.</p><p>(v) With respect to bids and offers for the individual legs of a Complex Order entered into the Complex Price Improvement Mechanism, the priority rules applicable to the execution of Complex Orders contained in Options 3, Section 14(c)(2) will continue to be applicable and may prevent the execution of a Complex Order entered into the Complex Price Improvement Mechanism, in which case the transaction will be cancelled. If an improved net price for the Complex Order being executed can be achieved from Complex Orders, Improvement Complex Orders on the Complex Order Book and, for Complex Options Orders, the ISE best bids and offers on the individual legs, the Agency Complex Order will be executed against such interest.</p>","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":456803,"ParentPartSourceId":"dc3c8d4d-a40e-837e-c1c1-837f71b3c3de","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":393531,"LegislationSourceId":"da4047d0-c2a7-7152-d78f-8730e8178f10","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Nasdaq ise rules","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"c1b5f8c4-474a-4691-9d47-999dd90894ec","JurisdictionName":"United States of America","IssuingBodySourceId":"64fc69f7-e62e-46d2-a6f9-1d91d3c85d51","IssuingBodyName":"Nasdaq ISE","PartVersionId":456668,"PartSourceId":"80d3576c-6d13-23bf-3d5b-a9127dea56ef","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":18,"Content":"<p>.01 It shall be considered conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade for any Member to enter orders, quotes, Agency Orders, Counter-Side Orders or Improvement Orders for the purpose of disrupting or manipulating the Price Improvement Mechanism.

At the conclusion of the exposure period, any unexecuted balance of a Response is automatically cancelled.</p><p>(ii) The exposure period for a Complex Order will end immediately: (A) upon the receipt of a Complex Order for the same complex strategy on either side of the market that is marketable against the Complex Order Book or bids and offers for the individual legs; (B) upon the receipt of a non-marketable Complex Order for the same complex strategy on the same side of the market that would cause the price of the exposed Complex Order to be outside of the best bid or offer for the same complex strategy on the Complex Order Book; or (C) when a resting Complex Order for the same complex strategy on either side of the market becomes marketable against interest on the Complex Order book or bids and offers for same individual legs of the complex strategy.</p><p>(iii) A Complex Order Exposure in a complex strategy may be ongoing in a complex strategy at the same time as a Price Improvement Auction pursuant to Options 3, Section 13 or during an exposure period pursuant to Supplementary Material .02 to Options 5, Section 2 in a component leg(s) of such complex strategy. If a Complex Order Exposure is early terminated pursuant to paragraph (ii) above, and the incoming Complex Order that causes the early termination in the complex strategy is also marketable against a component leg(s) of the complex strategy that is the subject of a concurrent ongoing Price Improvement Auction pursuant to Options 3, Section 13 or an exposure period pursuant to Supplementary Material .02 to Options 5, Section 2, then the concurrent Complex Order and component leg auction(s) are processed in the following sequence: (1) the Complex Order exposure is early terminated; (2) the component leg auction(s), which are early terminated and processed; and (3) legging of residual incoming Complex Order interest occurs.</p><p>(c) At the end of the exposure period, if the Complex Order still improves upon the best price for the complex strategy on the same side of the market, it is automatically executed to the greatest extent possible pursuant to subparagraph (d)(2)-(3), taking into consideration: (i) bids and offers on the Complex Order Book (including interest received during the exposure period), (ii) bids and offers on the Exchange for the individual options series (including interest received during the exposure period), and (iii) Responses received during the exposure period, provided that when allocating pursuant to subparagraph (d)(2)(ii), Responses are allocated pro-rata based on size. Thereafter, any unexecuted balance will be placed on the Complex Order Book (or cancelled in the case of an Exposure Only Complex Order). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Supplementary Material .01(c)(ii) to this Rule shall not be applicable with respect to Stock Option Orders and Stock Complex Orders.</p><p>(d) If a trading halt is initiated during the exposure period in any series underlying the Complex Order, the Complex Order exposure process will be automatically terminated without execution.</p><p>.02 Stock-Option and Stock-Complex Orders. The Exchange will electronically communicate the stock leg of an executable Stock-Option Order and Stock-Complex Order to a broker-dealer for execution. To execute Stock-Option Orders and Stock-Complex Orders on the Exchange, Members must enter into a brokerage agreement with a broker-dealer designated by the Exchange. The Member may also enter into a brokerage agreement with one or more other broker-dealers to which the Exchange is able to route stock orders. The Exchange will automatically transmit the stock leg of a trade to one-or more broker-dealer(s) with which a Member has an agreement for execution on behalf of the Member using routing logic that takes into consideration objective factors such as execution cost, speed of execution and fill-rates. The Exchange will have no financial arrangements with the brokers with respect to routing stock orders to them. Members may also indicate preferred execution brokers, and such preferences will determine order routing priority whenever possible. A trade of a Stock-Option Order or a Stock-Complex Order will be automatically cancelled if market conditions prevent the execution of the stock or option leg(s) at the prices necessary to achieve the agreed upon net price. When a Stock-Option Order or Stock-Complex Order has been matched with another Stock-Option Order or Stock-Complex Order that is for less than the full size of the Stock-Option Order or Stock-Complex Order, the full size of the Stock-Option Order or Stock Complex Order being processed by the stock execution venue will be unavailable for trading while the order is being processed.</p><p>.03 Trade Value Allowance. To facilitate the execution of the stock leg and options leg(s) of Stock-Option Strategies and Stock-Complex Strategies at valid increments pursuant to subparagraph (c)(1), Stock-Option Strategies and Stock-Complex Strategies may trade outside of their expected notional trade value by a specified amount (&#8220;Trade Value Allowance&#8221;). The Trade Value Allowance is the percentage difference between the expected notional value of a trade and the actual notional value of the trade. The amount of Trade Value Allowance permitted may be determined by the Member, or a default value determined by the Exchange and announced to Members; provided that any amount of Trade Value Allowance is permitted in mechanisms pursuant to Options 3, Section 11 when auction orders do not trade solely with their contra-side order.</p><p>.04 Complex Opening Process. After each of the individual component legs have opened, or reopened following a trading halt, Complex Options Strategies will be opened pursuant to the Complex Opening Price Determination described in Supplementary Material .05 to this Rule, and Stock-Option Strategies and Stock-Complex Strategies will be opened pursuant to the Complex Uncrossing Process described in Supplementary Material .06(b) to this Rule.</p><p>.05 Complex Opening Price Determination.</p><p>(a) Definitions.</p><p>(1) &#8220;Boundary Price&#8221; is described herein in paragraph (d)(1).</p><p>(2) &#8220;Opening Price&#8221; is described herein in paragraph (d)(4).</p><p>(3) &#8220;Potential Opening Price&#8221; is described herein in paragraph (d)(2).</p><p>(b) Eligible Interest. Eligible interest during the Complex Opening Price Determination includes Complex Orders on the Complex Order Book. Bids and offers for the individual legs of the complex strategy are not eligible to participate in the Complex Opening Price Determination.</p><p>(c) If the best bid for a complex strategy does not lock or cross the best offer, there will be no trade in the Complex Opening Price Determination and the complex strategy will open pursuant to the Complex Uncrossing Process described in Supplementary Material .06(b) to this Rule.</p><p>(d) If the best bid for a complex strategy locks or crosses the best offer, the System will open the complex strategy as follows:</p><p>(1) Boundary Prices. The System calculates Boundary Prices at or within which Complex Orders may be executed during the Complex Opening Price Determination based on the NBBO for the individual legs; provided that, if the NBBO for any leg includes a Priority Customer Order on the Exchange, the System adjusts the Boundary Prices according to subparagraph (c)(2).</p><p>(2) Potential Opening Price. The System will calculate the Potential Opening Price by identifying the price(s) at which the maximum number of contracts can trade (&#8220;maximum quantity criterion&#8221;) taking into consideration all eligible interest pursuant to Supplementary Material .06(b) to this Rule.</p><p>(3) More Than One Potential Opening Price. When two or more Potential Opening Prices would satisfy the maximum quantity criterion: (A) without leaving unexecuted contracts on the bid or offer side of the market of Complex Orders to be traded at those prices, the System takes the highest and lowest of those prices and takes the mid-point; provided that (1) if the highest and/or lowest price described above is through the price of a bid or offer that is priced to not allocate in the Complex Opening Price Determination, the highest and/or lowest price will be rounded to the price of such bid or offer that is priced to not allocate before taking the mid-point, and (2) if the midpoint is not expressed as a permitted minimum trading increment, it will be rounded down to the nearest permissible minimum trading increment; or (B) leaving unexecuted contracts on the bid (offer) side of the market of Complex Orders to be traded at those prices, the Potential Opening Price is the highest (lowest) executable bid (offer) price. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (C) if there are Market Complex Orders on the bid (offer) side of the market that would equal the full quantity of Complex Orders on offer (bid) side of the market, the limit price of the highest (lowest) priced Limit Complex Order is the Potential Opening Price; and (D) if there are only Market Complex Orders on both sides of the market, or if there are Market Complex Orders on the bid (offer) side of the market for greater than the total size of Complex Orders on the offer (bid) side of the market, there will be no trade in the Complex Opening Price Determination and the complex strategy will open pursuant to the Complex Uncrossing Process described in Supplementary Material .06(b) to this Rule.</p><p>(4) Opening Price. If the Potential Opening Price is at or within the Boundary Prices, the Potential Opening Price becomes the Opening Price. If the Potential Opening Price is not at or within the Boundary Prices, the Opening Price will be the price closest to the Potential Opening Price that satisfies the maximum quantity criteria without leaving unexecuted contracts on the bid or offer side of the market at that price and is at or within the Boundary Prices. If the bid Boundary Price is higher than the offer Boundary Price, or if no valid Opening Price can be found at or within the Boundary Prices, there will be no trade in the Complex Opening Price Determination and the complex strategy will open pursuant to the Complex Uncrossing Process described in Supplementary Material .06(b) to this Rule.</p><p>(5) Allocation. During the Complex Opening Price Determination, where there is an execution possible, the System will give priority to Market Complex Orders first, then to resting Limit Complex Orders on the Complex Order Book. The allocation provisions of subparagraph (d)(2) apply with respect to Complex Orders with the same price with priority given first to better priced interest.</p><p>(6) Uncrossing. If the Complex Order Book remains locked or crossed following paragraphs (d)(1) - (5), the System will process any remaining Complex Orders, including Opening Only Complex Orders in accordance with the Complex Uncrossing Process described in Supplementary Material .06(b) to this Rule. Bids and offers for the individual legs of the Complex Option Order will also be eligible to trade in the Complex Uncrossing Process.</p><p>.06 Complex Uncrossing Process.</p><p>(a) The Complex Order Book will be uncrossed using the Complex Uncrossing Process described in paragraph (b) below if a resting Complex Order that is locked or crossed with other interest becomes executable during regular trading or as part of the Complex Opening Process.</p><p>(b) Complex Strategies are uncrossed using the following procedure:</p><p>(1) The System identifies the oldest Complex Order among the best priced bids and offers on the Complex Order Book. A Complex Order entered with an instruction that it must be executed at a price that is equal to or better than the national best bid or offer pursuant to paragraph (a) above is considered based on its actual limit or market price and not the price of the national best bid or offer for the component legs.</p><p>(2) The selected Complex Order is matched pursuant to subparagraph (d)(2)-(3) with resting contra-side interest on the Complex Order Book and, for Complex Option Orders, bids and offers for the individual legs of the complex strategy.</p><p>(3) The process described in (1) through (2) is repeated until the Complex Order Book is no longer executable.</p><p>.07 Qualified Contingent Trade Exemption. Members may only submit Complex Orders n Stock-Option Strategies and Stock-Complex Strategies if such Complex Orders comply with the Qualified Contingent Trade Exemption from Rule 611(a) of Regulation NMS under the Exchange Act. Members submitting Complex Orders in Stock-Option Strategies and Stock-Complex Strategies represent that they comply with the Qualified Contingent Trade Exemption. In addition, the stock leg of a stock-option order must be marked &#8220;buy,&#8221; &#8220;sell,&#8221; &#8220;sell short,&#8221; or &#8220;sell short exempt&#8221; in compliance with Regulation SHO under the Exchange Act.</p><p>[Adopted June 6, 2019 (SR-ISE-2019-17).]</p>","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":456803,"ParentPartSourceId":"dc3c8d4d-a40e-837e-c1c1-837f71b3c3de","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":393531,"LegislationSourceId":"da4047d0-c2a7-7152-d78f-8730e8178f10","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Nasdaq ise rules","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"c1b5f8c4-474a-4691-9d47-999dd90894ec","JurisdictionName":"United States of America","IssuingBodySourceId":"64fc69f7-e62e-46d2-a6f9-1d91d3c85d51","IssuingBodyName":"Nasdaq ISE","PartVersionId":4900372,"PartSourceId":"742fbe25-c641-baf2-4b49-6452803734a2","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":21,"Content":"<p>Incoming single leg orders that are executable against orders and quotes in the System will be executed automatically by the System subject to the following:</p><p>(a) NBBO Price Protection. Orders, other than Intermarket Sweep Orders (as defined in Rule Options 5, Section 1(h)), will not be automatically executed by the System at prices inferior to the NBBO (as defined in Options 5, Section 1(j)).</p><p>(1) Orders that are not automatically executed will be handled as provided in Supplementary Material .02 to Options 5, Section 2; provided that Members may specify that a Non-Customer order should instead be rejected automatically by the System at the time of receipt.</p><p>(2) There is no NBBO price protection with respect to any other market whose quotations are Non-Firm (as defined in Options 5, Section 1(k)).</p><p>(b) Other Single Leg Risk Protections. Subject to the NBBO price protection in (a) above, the following additional risk protections are automatically enforced by the System. In the event of unusual market conditions and in the interest of a fair and orderly market, the Exchange may temporarily establish the levels at which the order protections contained in this paragraph are triggered as necessary and appropriate.</p><p>(1) The following are order risk protections on ISE:</p><p>(A) Limit Order Price Protection. There is a limit on the amount by which incoming limit orders to buy may be priced above the Exchange&apos;s best offer and by which incoming limit orders to sell may be priced below the Exchange&apos;s best bid. Limit orders that exceed the pricing limit are rejected. The limit is established by the Exchange from time-to-time for orders to buy (sell) as the greater of the Exchange&apos;s best offer (bid) plus (minus): (i) an absolute amount not to exceed $2.00, or (ii) a percentage of the Exchange&apos;s best bid/offer not to exceed 10%. Limit Order Price Protection shall not apply to the Opening Process or during a trading halt.</p><p>(B) Market Order Spread Protection. Market Orders will be rejected if the NBBO is wider than a preset threshold at the time the order is received by the System. Market Order Spread Protection shall not apply to the Opening Process or during a trading halt. The Exchange may establish different thresholds for one or more series or classes of options.</p><p>(C) Size Limitation. There is a limit on the number of contracts an incoming order may specify. Orders that exceed the maximum number of contracts are rejected. The maximum number of contracts, which shall not be less than 10,000, is established by the Exchange from time-to-time.</p><p>(D) Market Wide Risk Protection. All Members must provide parameters for the order entry and execution rate protections described in this Rule. The Exchange will also establish default values for each of these parameters that apply to Members that do not submit the required parameters, and will announce these default values in an Options Trader Alert to be distributed to Members. The System will maintain one or more counting programs for each Member that count orders entered and contracts traded on Nasdaq ISE or across both Nasdaq ISE and Nasdaq GEMX. Members can use multiple counting programs to separate risk protections for different groups established within the Member. The counting programs will maintain separate counts, over rolling time periods specified by the Member for each count, of: (1) the total number of orders entered in the regular order book; (2) the total number of orders entered in the complex order book with only options legs; (3) the total number of orders entered in the complex order book with both stock and options legs; (4) the total number of contracts traded in regular orders; and (5) the total number of contracts traded in complex orders with only options legs. The minimum and maximum duration of the applicable time period will be established by the Exchange and announced via an Options Trader Alert.</p><p>(i) If, during the applicable time period, the Member exceeds thresholds that it has set for any of the order entry or execution counts described above on Nasdaq ISE, or across both Nasdaq ISE and Nasdaq GEMX, in either case as set by the Member, the System will automatically reject all subsequent incoming orders entered by the Member on Nasdaq ISE or, if applicable, across both Nasdaq ISE and Nasdaq GEMX, including both regular and Complex Orders.</p><p>(ii) Members may also choose to have the System automatically cancel all of their existing orders on Nasdaq ISE, or across both Nasdaq ISE and Nasdaq GEMX, in either case as set by the Member, when the Market Wide Risk Protection is triggered.</p><p>(iii) The Market Wide Risk Protection will remain engaged until the Member manually notifies the Exchange to enable the acceptance of new orders. For Members that still have open orders on the order book that have not been cancelled pursuant to subparagraph (b)(1)(D)(ii) above, the System will continue to allow those Members to interact with existing orders entered before the protection was triggered, including sending cancel order messages and receiving trade executions for those orders.</p><p>(2) The following are order and quote risk protections on ISE:</p><p>(A) Acceptable Trade Range.</p><p>(i) The System will calculate an Acceptable Trade Range to limit the range of prices at which an order or quote will be allowed to execute. The Acceptable Trade Range is calculated by taking the reference price, plus or minus a value to be determined by the Exchange (i.e., the reference price - (x) for sell orders/quotes and the reference price + (x) for buy orders or quotes). The Acceptable Trade Range will not be available for all-or-none orders.</p><p>(ii) The reference price is the NBB for sell orders/quotes and the NBO for buy orders/quotes. The reference price is calculated upon receipt of a new order or quote, provided that if the applicable NBB or NBO price is improved at the time an order is routed to an away market, a new reference price is calculated based on the NBB or NBO at that time.</p><p>(iii) If an order or quote reaches the outer limit of the Acceptable Trade Range without being fully executed then any unexecuted balance will be cancelled.</p><p>(iv) There will be three categories of options for Acceptable Trade Range: (1) Penny Pilot Options trading in one cent increments for options trading at less than $3.00 and increments of five cents for options trading at $3.00 or more, (2) Penny Pilot Options trading in one-cent increments for all prices, and (3) Non-Penny Pilot Options.</p><p>(3) The following are Market Maker risk protections on ISE:</p><p>(A) Anti-Internalization. Quotes and orders entered by Market Makers will not be executed against quotes and orders entered on the opposite side of the market by the same Market Maker using the same Market Maker identifiers, or alternatively, if selected by the Member, the same Exchange account number or Member firm identifier. In such a case, the System will cancel the resting quote or order back to the entering party prior to execution. This functionality shall not apply in any auction or with respect to Complex Order transactions.</p><p>(B) Automated Quotation Adjustments.</p><p>(i) Market Makers are required to utilize the Percentage, Volume, Delta and Vega Thresholds, each a Threshold, described in (a) - (d) below. For each of these features, the System will automatically remove a Market Maker&apos;s quotes in all series in an options class when any of the Percentage Threshold, Volume Threshold, Delta Threshold or Vega Threshold, as described below, has been exceeded. A Market Maker is required to specify a period of time not to exceed 30 seconds (&#8220;Specified Time Period&#8221;) during which the System will automatically remove a Market Maker&apos;s quotes in all series of an options class. The Specified Time Period will commence for an options class every time an execution occurs in any series in such option class and will continue until the System removes quotes as described in (ii) or (iii) or the Specified Time Period expires. The Specified Time Period operates on a rolling basis among all series in an options class in that there may be Specified Time Periods occurring simultaneously for each Threshold and such Specified Time Periods may overlap. The Specified Time Periods will be the same value for each protection described in (a) - (d) below.</p><p>(a) Percentage Threshold. A Market Maker must provide a specified percentage (&#8220;Percentage Threshold&#8221;), of not less than 1%, by which the System will automatically remove a Market Maker&apos;s quotes in all series of an options class. For each series in an options class, the System will determine (i) during a Specified Time Period and for each side in a given series, a percentage calculated by dividing the size of a Market Maker&apos;s quote size executed in a particular series (the numerator) by the Marker Maker&apos;s quote size available at the time of execution plus the total number of the Market Marker&apos;s quote size previously executed during the unexpired Specified Time Period (the denominator) (&#8220;Series Percentage&#8221;); and (ii) the sum of the Series Percentage in the options class (&#8220;Issue Percentage&#8221;) during a Specified Time Period. The System tracks and calculates the net impact of positions in the same options class; long call percentages are offset by short call percentages, and long put percentages are offset by short put percentages in the Issue Percentage. If the Issue Percentage exceeds the Percentage Threshold the System will automatically remove a Market Maker&apos;s quotes in all series of the options class during the Specified Time Period.</p><p>(b) Volume Threshold. A Market Maker must provide a Volume Threshold by which the System will automatically remove a Market Maker&apos;s quotes in all series of an options class when the Market Maker executes a number of contracts which exceeds the designated number of contracts in all series in an options class.</p><p>(c) Delta Threshold. A Market Maker must provide a Delta Threshold by which the System will automatically remove a Market Maker&apos;s quotes in all series of an options class. For each class of options, the System will maintain a Delta counter, which tracks the absolute value of the difference between (i) purchased call contracts plus sold put contracts and (ii) sold call contracts plus purchased put contracts. If the Delta counter exceeds the Delta Threshold established by the Member, the System will automatically remove a Market Maker&apos;s quotes in all series of the options class.</p><p>(d) Vega Threshold. A Market Maker must provide a Vega Threshold by which the System will automatically remove a Market Maker&apos;s quotes in all series of an options class. For each class of options, the System will maintain a Vega counter, which tracks the absolute value of purchased contracts minus sold contracts. If the Vega counter exceeds the Vega Threshold established by the Member, the System will automatically remove a Market Maker&apos;s quotes in all series of the options class.</p><p>(ii) The System will automatically remove quotes in all series of an options class when the Percentage Threshold, Volume Threshold, Delta Threshold or Vega Threshold has been exceeded. The System will send a Purge Notification Message to the Market Maker for all affected series when the above thresholds have been exceeded.</p><p>(a) The Percentage Threshold, Volume Threshold, Delta Threshold and Vega Threshold are considered independently of each other.</p><p>(b) Quotes will be automatically executed up to the Market Maker&apos;s size regardless of whether the execution would cause the Market Maker to exceed the Percentage Threshold, Volume Threshold, Delta Threshold or Vega Threshold</p><p>(iii) Notwithstanding subparagraph (b)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) above, if a Market Maker requests the System to remove quotes in all series of an options class, the System will automatically reset all Thresholds.</p><p>(iv) When the System removes quotes as a result of exceeding the Percentage Threshold, Volume Threshold, Delta Threshold or Vega Threshold, the Market Maker must send a re-entry indicator to re-enter the System.</p><p>(v) If a Market Maker does not provide a parameter for each of the automated quotation removal protections described in (B)(i)(a) - (d) above, the Exchange will apply default parameters, which are announced to Members.</p><p>(vi) In addition to the automated quotation removal protections described in (B)(i)(a) - (d) above, a Market Maker must provide a market wide parameter by which the Exchange will automatically remove a Market Maker&apos;s quotes in all classes when, during a time period established by the Market Maker, the total number of quote removal events specified in (B)(i)(a) - (d) above and in Supplementary Material .04 to Options 3, Section 14 exceeds the market wide parameter provided to the Exchange by the Market Maker. Market Makers may request the Exchange to set the market wide parameter to apply to just Nasdaq ISE or across Nasdaq ISE and Nasdaq GEMX. Market Makers must request the Exchange enable re-entry by contacting the Exchange&apos;s Operations Department.</p><p>[Adopted June 6, 2019 (SR-ISE-2019-17).]</p>","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":456803,"ParentPartSourceId":"dc3c8d4d-a40e-837e-c1c1-837f71b3c3de","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":393531,"LegislationSourceId":"da4047d0-c2a7-7152-d78f-8730e8178f10","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Nasdaq ise rules","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"c1b5f8c4-474a-4691-9d47-999dd90894ec","JurisdictionName":"United States of America","IssuingBodySourceId":"64fc69f7-e62e-46d2-a6f9-1d91d3c85d51","IssuingBodyName":"Nasdaq ISE","PartVersionId":4900373,"PartSourceId":"182af63d-4803-80e7-75ac-34c8c68b4b2b","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":22,"Content":"<p>The following are Complex Order risk protections on ISE:</p><p>(a) Price limits for Complex Orders. As provided in Options 5, Section 14(d)(2), the legs of a complex strategy may be executed at prices that are inferior to the prices available on other exchanges trading the same options series. Notwithstanding, the System will not permit any leg of a complex strategy to trade through the NBBO for the series or any stock component by a configurable amount calculated as the lesser of (i) an absolute amount not to exceed $0.10, and (ii) a percentage of the NBBO not to exceed 500%, as determined by the Exchange on a class, series or underlying basis. A Member can also include an instruction on a Complex Order that each leg of the Complex Order is to be executed only at a price that is equal to or better than the NBBO for the options series or any stock component, as applicable.</p><p>(1) The System will reject orders for a complex strategy where all legs are to buy if entered at a price that is less than the minimum net price, which is calculated as the sum of the ratio on each leg of the complex strategy multiplied by the minimum increment applicable to that leg pursuant to Options 5, Section 14(c)(1).</p><p>(b) Strategy Protections. The following protections will apply throughout the trading day, including pre-market, during the Opening Process and during a trading halt. The protections will not apply to Complex Orders being auctioned and auction responses in the Facilitation Mechanism, Solicited Order Mechanism, and Price Improvement Mechanism and will not apply to Customer Cross Orders pursuant to Options 5, Section 12(a).</p><p>(1) Vertical Spread Protection. The Vertical Spread Protection will apply to a vertical spread. A vertical spread is an order to buy a call (put) option and to sell another call (put) option in the same security with the same expiration but at a higher (lower) strike price).</p><p>(A) The System will reject a Vertical Spread order when entered with a net price of less than zero (minus a pre-set value), and will prevent the execution of a Vertical Spread order at a price that is less than zero (minus a pre-set value) when entered as a Market Order to sell. The Exchange will set a pre-set value not to exceed $1.00 to be applied uniformly across all classes. The Exchange may amend the pre-set value uniformly across all classes.</p><p>(B) The System will reject a Vertical Spread order when entered with a net price greater than the value of the higher strike price minus the lower strike price (plus a pre-set value), and will prevent the execution of a Vertical Spread order at a price that is greater than the value of the higher strike price minus the lower strike price (plus a pre-set value) when entered as a Market Order to buy. The pre-set value used by the vertical spread check will be the lesser of (1) an absolute amount not to exceed $1.00 and (2) a percentage of the difference between the strike prices not to exceed 10% to be applied uniformly across all classes. The Exchange may amend the pre-set value uniformly across all classes.</p><p>(2) Calendar Spread Protection. The Calendar Spread Protection will apply to a Calendar Spread. A calendar spread is an order to buy a call (put) option with a longer expiration and to sell another call (put) option with a shorter expiration in the same security at the same strike price.</p><p>(A) The System will reject a Calendar Spread order when entered with a net price of less than zero (minus a preset value), and will prevent the execution of a Calendar Spread order at a price that is less than zero (minus a pre-set value) when entered as a Market Complex Order to sell. The Exchange will set a pre-set value not to exceed $1.00 to be applied uniformly across all classes. The Exchange may amend the pre-set value uniformly across all classes.</p><p>(3) Butterfly Spread Protection. The Butterfly Spread Protection will apply to a butterfly spread. A butterfly spread is a three legged Complex Order with the following: (1) two legs to buy (sell) the same number of calls (puts); (2) one leg to sell (buy) twice the number of calls (puts) with a strike price at mid-point of the two legs to buy (sell); (3) all legs have the same expiration; and (4) each leg strike price is equidistant from the next sequential strike price.</p><p>(A) A Butterfly Spread Limit Order that is priced higher than the Maximum Value or lower than the Minimum Value will be rejected. A Butterfly Spread Market Order (or Butterfly Spread Limit Order entered with a net price inside the Butterfly Spread Protection Range) to buy (sell) will be restricted from executing by legging into the single leg market with a net price higher (lower) than the Maximum (Minimum) Value. The Butterfly Spread Protection Range is the absolute difference between the Minimum Value and the Maximum Value.</p><p>(i) The Initial Maximum Value is the distance between the strike price of the leg with the mid-point strike and either of the outer leg strike prices. The Maximum Value Buffer is the lesser of a configurable absolute dollar value or percentage of the Initial Maximum Value set by the Exchange and announced via a notice to Members. The Maximum Value is calculated by adding the Initial Maximum Value and Maximum Value Buffer.</p><p>(ii) The Initial Minimum Value is zero. The Minimum Value Buffer is a configurable absolute dollar value set by the Exchange and announced via a notice to Members. The Minimum Value is calculated by subtracting the Minimum Value Buffer from the Initial Minimum Value of zero.</p><p>(4) Box Spread Protection. The Box Spread Protection will apply to a box spread. A box spread is a four legged Complex Order with the following: (1) one pair of legs with the same strike price with one leg to buy a call (put) and one leg to sell a put (call); (2) a second pair of legs with a different strike price from the pair described in (1) with one leg to sell a call (put) and one leg to buy a put (call); (3) all legs have the same expiration; and (4) all legs have equal volume.</p><p>(A) A Box Spread Limit Order that is priced higher than the Maximum Value or lower than the Minimum Value will be rejected. A Box Spread Market Order (or Box Spread Limit Order entered with a net price inside the Box Spread Protection Range) to buy (sell) will be restricted from executing by legging into the single leg market with a net price higher (lower) than the Maximum (Minimum) Value. The Box Spread Protection Range is the absolute difference between the Minimum Value and the Maximum Value.</p><p>(i) The Initial Maximum Value is the distance between the strike prices of each pair of leg strike prices. The Maximum Value Buffer is the lesser of a configurable absolute dollar value or percentage of the Initial Maximum Value set by the Exchange and announced via a notice to Members. The Maximum Value is calculated by adding the Initial Maximum Value and Maximum Value Buffer.</p><p>(ii) The Initial Minimum Value is zero. The Minimum Value Buffer is a configurable absolute dollar value set by the Exchange and announced via a notice to Members. The Minimum Value is calculated by subtracting the Minimum Value Buffer from the Initial Minimum Value of zero.</p><p>(c) Other Price Protections which apply to Complex Orders.</p><p>(1) Limit Order Price Protection. There is a limit on the amount by which the net price of an incoming Limit Complex Order to buy may exceed the net price available from the individual options series on the Exchange and the national best bid or offer for any stock leg, and by which the net price of an incoming Limit Complex Order to sell may be below the net price available from the individual options series on the Exchange and the national best bid or offer for any stock leg. Limit Complex Orders that exceed the pricing limit are rejected. The limit is established by the Exchange from time-to-time for Limit Complex Orders to buy (sell) as the net price available from the individual options series on the Exchange and the national best bid or offer for any stock leg plus (minus) the greater of: (i) an absolute amount not to exceed $2.00, or (ii) a percentage of the net price available from the individual options series on the Exchange and the national best bid or offer for any stock leg not to exceed 10%.</p><p>(2) Size Limitation. There is a limit on the number of contracts (and shares in the case of a Stock-Option Strategy or Stock-Complex Strategy) any single leg of an incoming Complex Order may specify. Orders that exceed the maximum number of contracts (or shares) are rejected. The maximum number of contracts (or shares), which shall not be less than 10,000 (or 100,000 shares), is established by the Exchange from time-to-time.</p><p>(3) Price Level Protection. There is a limit on the number of price levels at which an incoming Complex Order to sell (buy) will be executed automatically with the bids or offers of each component leg when there are no bids (offers) from other exchanges at any price for the options series. Complex Orders are executed at each successive price level until the maximum number of price levels is reached on any component leg where the protection has been triggered, and any balance is canceled. The number of price levels for the component leg, which may be from one (1) to ten (10), is determined by the Exchange from time-to-time on a class-by-class basis.</p><p>[Adopted June 6, 2019 (SR-ISE-2019-17).]</p>","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":456803,"ParentPartSourceId":"dc3c8d4d-a40e-837e-c1c1-837f71b3c3de","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":393531,"LegislationSourceId":"da4047d0-c2a7-7152-d78f-8730e8178f10","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Nasdaq ise rules","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"c1b5f8c4-474a-4691-9d47-999dd90894ec","JurisdictionName":"United States of America","IssuingBodySourceId":"64fc69f7-e62e-46d2-a6f9-1d91d3c85d51","IssuingBodyName":"Nasdaq ISE","PartVersionId":4900374,"PartSourceId":"e7032842-8562-508a-1b6e-da671c26bd9b","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":23,"Content":"<p>(a) Kill Switch enables Members to initiate a message to the System to promptly cancel orders and restrict entry of new orders until re-entry has been enabled.

For purposes of this provision, when a single order received by the Exchange is executed at multiple price levels, the last NBB and last NBO just prior to the trade in question would be the last NBB and last NBO just prior to the Exchange&apos;s receipt of the order. The Exchange will rely on this paragraph (b) and Supplementary Material .06 of this Rule when determining Theoretical Price.</p><p>(1) Transactions at the Open. For a transaction occurring during the opening rotation (see Options 3, Section 8) the Exchange will determine the Theoretical Price if there is no NBB or NBO for the affected series just prior to the erroneous transaction or if the bid/ask differential of the NBB and NBO just prior to the erroneous transaction is equal to or greater than the Minimum Amount set forth in the chart contained in sub-paragraph (b)(3) below. If the bid/ask differential is less than the Minimum Amount, the Theoretical Price is the NBB or NBO just prior to the erroneous transaction.</p><p>(2) No Valid Quotes.

For an execution of any order other than a Customer order, a filing must be received by the Exchange within fifteen (15) minutes of the execution, subject to sub-paragraph (C) below.</p><p>(C) Linkage Trades. Any other options exchange will have a total of forty-five (45) minutes for Customer orders and thirty (30) minutes for non-Customer orders, measured from the time of execution on the Exchange, to file with the Exchange for review of transactions routed to the Exchange from that options exchange and executed on the Exchange (&#8220;linkage trades&#8221;). This includes filings on behalf of another options exchange filed by a third-party routing broker if such third-party broker identifies the affected transactions as linkage trades. In order to facilitate timely reviews of linkage trades the Exchange will accept filings from either the other options exchange or, if applicable, the third-party routing broker that routed the applicable order(s). The additional fifteen (15) minutes provided with respect to linkage trades shall only apply to the extent the options exchange that originally received and routed the order to the Exchange itself received a timely filing from the entering participant (i.e., within 30 minutes if a Customer order or 15 minutes if a non-Customer order).</p><p>(3) Official Acting on Own Motion. An Official may review a transaction believed to be erroneous on his/her own motion in the interest of maintaining a fair and orderly market and for the protection of investors. A transaction reviewed pursuant to this paragraph may be nullified or adjusted only if it is determined by the Official that the transaction is erroneous in accordance with the provisions of this Rule, provided that the time deadlines of sub-paragraph (c)(2) above shall not apply. The Official shall act as soon as possible after becoming aware of the transaction, and ordinarily would be expected to act on the same day that the transaction occurred. In no event shall the Official act later than 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on the next trading day following the date of the transaction in question. A party affected by a determination to nullify or adjust a transaction pursuant to this provision may appeal such determination in accordance with paragraph (k) below; however, a determination by an Official not to review a transaction or determination not to nullify or adjust a transaction for which a review was conducted on an Official&apos;s own motion is not appealable. If a transaction is reviewed and a determination is rendered pursuant to another provision of this Rule, no additional relief may be granted under this provision.</p><p>(4) Adjust or Bust. If it is determined that an Obvious Error has occurred, the Exchange shall take one of the actions listed below. Upon taking final action, the Exchange shall promptly notify both parties to the trade electronically or via telephone.</p><p>(A) Non-Customer Transactions. Where neither party to the transaction is a Customer, the execution price of the transaction will be adjusted by the Official pursuant to the table below.

For transactions in an expiring options series that take place on an expiration day, a party must notify the Exchange&apos;s Market Control within 45 minutes after the close of trading that same day.</p><p>(3) Adjust or Bust. If it is determined that a Catastrophic Error has occurred, the Exchange shall take action as set forth below. Upon taking final action, the Exchange shall promptly notify both parties to the trade electronically or via telephone. In the event of a Catastrophic Error, the execution price of the transaction will be adjusted by the Official pursuant to the table below. Any Customer order subject to this sub-paragraph will be nullified if the adjustment would result in an execution price higher (for buy transactions) or lower (for sell transactions) than the Customer&apos;s limit price.</p><table><tr><th><p>Theoretical Price (TP)</p></th><th><p>Buy Transaction Adjustment - TP Plus</p></th><th><p>Sell Transaction Adjustment - TP Minus</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>Below $2.00</p></td><td><p>$0.50</p></td><td><p>$0.50</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>$2.00 to $5.00</p></td><td><p>$1.00</p></td><td><p>$1.00</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Above $5.00 to $10.00</p></td><td><p>$1.50</p></td><td><p>$1.50</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Above $10.00 to $20.00</p></td><td><p>$2.00</p></td><td><p>$2.00</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Above $20.00 to $50.00</p></td><td><p>$2.50</p></td><td><p>$2.50</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Above $50.00 to $100.00</p></td><td><p>$3.00</p></td><td><p>$3.00</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Above $100.00</p></td><td><p>$4.00</p></td><td><p>$4.00</p></td></tr></table><p>(e) Significant Market Events.</p><p>(1) Definition.

All criteria set forth below will be measured in aggregate across all exchanges.</p><p>(A) Transactions that are potentially erroneous would result in a total Worst-Case Adjustment Penalty of $30,000,000, where the Worst-Case Adjustment Penalty is computed as the sum, across all potentially erroneous trades, of:</p><p>(i) $0.30 (i.e., the largest Transaction Adjustment value listed in sub-paragraph (e)(3)(A) below); times</p><p>(ii) the contract multiplier for each traded contract; times</p><p>(iii) the number of contracts for each trade; times</p><p>(iv) the appropriate Size Adjustment Modifier for each trade, if any, as defined in sub-paragraph (e)(3)(A) below.</p><p>(B) Transactions involving 500,000 options contracts are potentially erroneous;</p><p>(C) Transactions with a notional value (i.e., number of contracts traded multiplied by the option premium multiplied by the contract multiplier) of $100,000,000 are potentially erroneous;</p><p>(D) 10,000 transactions are potentially erroneous.</p><p>(2) Coordination with Other Options Exchanges. To ensure consistent application across options exchanges, in the event of a suspected Significant Market Event, the Exchange shall initiate a coordinated review of potentially erroneous transactions with all other affected options exchanges to determine the full scope of the event. When this paragraph is invoked, the Exchange will promptly coordinate with the other options exchanges to determine the appropriate review period as well as select one or more specific points in time prior to the transactions in question and use one or more specific points in time to determine Theoretical Price. Other than the selected points in time, if applicable, the Exchange will determine Theoretical Price in accordance with paragraph (b) above.</p><p>(3) Adjust or Bust. If it is determined that a Significant Market Event has occurred then, using the parameters agreed as set forth in sub-paragraph (e)(2) above, if applicable, an Official will determine whether any or all transactions under review qualify as Obvious Errors. The Exchange shall take one of the actions listed below with respect to all transactions that qualify as Obvious Errors pursuant to sub-paragraph (c)(1) above. Upon taking final action, the Exchange shall promptly notify both parties to the trade electronically or via telephone.</p><p>(A) The execution price of each affected transaction will be adjusted by an Official to the price provided below unless both parties agree to adjust the transaction to a different price or agree to bust the trade. In the context of a Significant Market Event, any error exceeding 50 contracts will be subject to the Size Adjustment Modifier defined in sub-paragraph (a)(4) above.</p><table><tr><th><p>Theoretical Price (TP)</p></th><th><p>Buy Transaction Adjustment - TP Plus</p></th><th><p>Sell Transaction Adjustment - TP Minus</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>Below $3.00</p></td><td><p>$0.15</p></td><td><p>$0.15</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>At or above $3.00</p></td><td><p>$0.30</p></td><td><p>$0.30</p></td></tr></table><p>(B) Where at least one party to the transaction is a Customer, the trade will be nullified if the adjustment would result in an execution price higher (for buy transactions) or lower (for sell transactions) than the Customer&apos;s limit price.</p><p>(4) Nullification of Transactions. If the Exchange, in consultation with other options exchanges, determines that timely adjustment is not feasible due to the extraordinary nature of the situation, then the Exchange will nullify some or all transactions arising out of the Significant Market Event during the review period selected by the Exchange and other options exchanges consistent with this paragraph. To the extent the Exchange, in consultation with other options exchanges, determines to nullify less than all transactions arising out of the Significant Market Event, those transactions subject to nullification will be selected based upon objective criteria with a view toward maintaining a fair and orderly market and the protection of investors and the public interest.</p><p>(5) Final Rulings. With respect to rulings made pursuant to this paragraph, the number of affected transactions is such that immediate finality is necessary to maintain a fair and orderly market and to protect investors and the public interest. Accordingly, rulings by the Exchange pursuant to this paragraph are non-appealable.</p><p>(f) Trading Halts. The Exchange shall nullify any transaction that occurs during a trading halt in the affected option on the Exchange pursuant to Options 8, Section 9.</p><p>(g) Erroneous Print in Underlying. A trade resulting from an erroneous print(s) disseminated by the underlying market that is later nullified by that underlying market shall be adjusted or busted as set forth in sub-paragraph (c)(4) of this Rule, provided a party notifies the Exchange&apos;s Market Control in a timely manner as set forth below. For purposes of this paragraph, a trade resulting from an erroneous print(s) shall mean any options trade executed during a period of time for which one or more executions in the underlying security are nullified and for one second thereafter. If a party believes that it participated in an erroneous transaction resulting from an erroneous print(s) pursuant to this paragraph it must notify the Exchange&apos;s Market Control within the timeframes set forth in sub-paragraph (c)(2) above, with the allowed notification timeframe commencing at the time of notification by the underlying market(s) of nullification of transactions in the underlying security. If multiple underlying markets nullify trades in the underlying security, the allowed notification timeframe will commence at the time of the first market&apos;s notification.</p><p>(h) Erroneous Quote in Underlying. A trade resulting from an erroneous quote(s) in the underlying security shall be adjusted or busted as set forth in sub-paragraph (c)(4) this Rule, provided a party notifies the Exchange&apos;s Market Control in a timely manner as set forth below. An erroneous quote occurs when the underlying security has a width of at least $1.00 and has a width at least five times greater than the average quote width for such underlying security during the time period encompassing two minutes before and after the dissemination of such quote. For purposes of this paragraph, the average quote width shall be determined by adding the quote widths of sample quotations at regular 15-second intervals during the four-minute time period referenced above (excluding the quote(s) in question) and dividing by the number of quotes during such time period (excluding the quote(s) in question). If a party believes that it participated in an erroneous transaction resulting from an erroneous quote(s) pursuant to this paragraph it must notify the Exchange&apos;s Market Control in accordance with sub-paragraph (c)(2) above.</p><p>(i) Stop (and Stop-Limit) Order Trades Triggered by Erroneous Trades. Transactions resulting from the triggering of a stop or stop-limit order by an erroneous trade in an option contract shall be nullified by the Exchange, provided a party notifies the Exchange&apos;s Market Control in a timely manner as set forth below. If a party believes that it participated in an erroneous transaction pursuant to this paragraph it must notify the Exchange&apos;s Market Control within the timeframes set forth in sub-paragraph (c)(2) above, with the allowed notification timeframe commencing at the time of notification of the nullification of transaction(s) that triggered the stop or stop-limit order.</p><p>(j) Linkage Trades. If the Exchange routes an order pursuant to the Plan (as defined in Options 5, Section 1(n)) that results in a transaction on another options exchange (a &#8220;Linkage Trade&#8221;) and such options exchange subsequently nullifies or adjusts the Linkage Trade pursuant to its rules, the Exchange will perform all actions necessary to complete the nullification or adjustment of the Linkage Trade.</p><p>(k) Appeals. If a Member affected by a determination made under this Rule so requests within the time permitted below, an Exchange Review Council panel will review decisions made by the Official under this Rule, including whether an obvious error occurred and whether the correct determination was made.</p><p>(1) An Exchange Review Council panel will be comprised minimally of representatives of one (1) Member engaged in market making and two (2) industry representatives not engaged in market making. At no time should a review panel have more than 50% Members engaged in market making.</p><p>(2) A request for review on appeal must be made in writing via e-mail or other electronic means specified from time to time by the Exchange in an Options Trader Alert distributed to Members within thirty (30) minutes after the party making the appeal is given notification of the initial determination being appealed. The Exchange Review Council panel shall review the facts and render a decision as soon as practicable, but generally on the same trading day as the execution(s) under review. On requests for appeal received after 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time, a decision will be rendered as soon as practicable, but in no case later than the trading day following the date of the execution under review.</p><p>(3) The Exchange Review Council panel may overturn or modify an action taken by the Official under this Rule. All determinations by the Exchange Review Council panel shall constitute final action by the Exchange on the matter at issue.</p><p>(4) If the Exchange Review Council panel votes to uphold the decision made pursuant to paragraph (k) above, the Exchange will assess a $5,000.00 fee against the Member(s) who initiated the request for appeal. In addition, in instances where the Exchange, on behalf of a Member, requests a determination by another market center that a transaction is clearly erroneous, the Exchange will pass any resulting charges through to the relevant Member.</p><p>(5) Any determination by an Official or by the Exchange Review Council panel shall be rendered without prejudice as to the rights of the parties to the transaction to submit their dispute to arbitration.</p><p>(l) Erroneous Trades due to System Disruptions and Malfunctions</p><p>(1) Verifiable Disruptions or Malfunctions of Exchange Systems.</p><p>(A) Transactions arising out of a &#8220;verifiable disruption or malfunction&#8221; in the use or operation of any Exchange automated quotation, dissemination, execution, or communication system may either be nullified or adjusted by Market Control. Transactions that qualify for price adjustment will be adjusted in accordance with the guidelines contained in Options 3, Section 20(b)(2)(i)(A) and (B).</p><p>(B) Absent extraordinary circumstances, any such action by Market Control pursuant to this Rule shall be initiated within sixty (60) minutes of the occurrence of the erroneous transaction that resulted from a verifiable disruption or malfunction. Each Member involved in the transaction shall be notified as soon as practicable.</p><p>(C) Any Member aggrieved by the action of Market Control taken pursuant to paragraph (A) above may appeal such action in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2).</p><p>(2) Procedures for Review of Decisions Made Pursuant to Options 3, Section 20(l)(1).</p><p>(A) If a party to a ruling by Market Control made pursuant to subsection (1) of this Rule requests within the time permitted below, an Exchange Review Council panel will be utilized to review decisions made by Market Control under this Rule.</p><p>(i) An Exchange Review Council panel will be comprised minimally of representatives of one (1) Member engaged in market making and two (2) industry representatives not engaged in market making. At no time should a review panel have more than 50% Members engaged in market making.</p><p>(ii) A request for review on appeal must be made via facsimile or e-mail within thirty (30) minutes after the party making the appeal is given notification of the initial determination being appealed. The Exchange Review Council panel shall review the facts and render a decision within the time frame prescribed by the Exchange.</p><p>(iii) The Exchange Review Council panel may overturn or modify an action taken by the Exchange under this Rule. All determinations by the Exchange Review Council panel shall constitute final action by the Exchange on the matter at issue.</p>","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":456803,"ParentPartSourceId":"dc3c8d4d-a40e-837e-c1c1-837f71b3c3de","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":393531,"LegislationSourceId":"da4047d0-c2a7-7152-d78f-8730e8178f10","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Nasdaq ise rules","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"c1b5f8c4-474a-4691-9d47-999dd90894ec","JurisdictionName":"United States of America","IssuingBodySourceId":"64fc69f7-e62e-46d2-a6f9-1d91d3c85d51","IssuingBodyName":"Nasdaq ISE","PartVersionId":4900377,"PartSourceId":"bae4b5fa-e481-1c84-18af-6a5b7349074b","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":27,"Content":"<p>.01 Limit Up-Limit Down State.

Whenever a stock trading venue nullifies the stock leg of a stock option order or whenever the stock leg cannot be executed, the Exchange will nullify the option leg upon request of one of the parties to the transaction or in accordance with paragraph (c)(3).</p><p>.06 Exchange Determining Theoretical Price. For purposes of this Rule, when the Exchange must determine Theoretical Price pursuant to sub-paragraphs (b)(1)-(3) of this Rule (i.e., at the open, when there are no valid quotes or when there is a wide quote), then the Exchange will determine Theoretical Price as follows.</p><p>(a) The Exchange will request Theoretical Price from the third party vendor defined in paragraph (d) below (&#8220;TP Provider&#8221;) to which the Exchange and all other options exchanges have subscribed.

The Exchange shall also promptly provide electronic notice to other options exchanges that the TP Provider has been contacted consistent with this paragraph and include a brief explanation of the reason for the request.</p><p>(c) An Official of the Exchange may determine the Theoretical Price if the TP Provider has experienced a systems issue that has rendered its services unavailable to accurately calculate Theoretical Price and such issue cannot be corrected in a timely manner.</p><p>(d) The current TP Provider to which the Exchange and all other options exchanges have subscribed is: CBOE Livevol, LLC.

In determining whether a Restructure Security satisfies the share guideline set forth in Options 4, Section 3(b)(1) (the &#8220;Share Guideline&#8221;) or the number of holders guideline set forth in Options 4, Section 3(b)(2) (the &#8220;Number of Shareholders Guideline&#8221;), the Exchange may rely upon the facts and circumstances that it expects to exist on the option&apos;s intended listing date, rather than on the date on which the Exchange selects for options trading the underlying Restructure Security.</p><p>(A) The Exchange may assume that:</p><p>(i) both the &#8220;Share&#8221; and &#8220;Number of Shareholders&#8221; Guidelines are satisfied if, on the option&apos;s intended listing date, the Exchange expects no fewer than forty (40) million shares of the Restructure Security to be issued and outstanding; and</p><p>(ii) either such Guideline is satisfied if, on the option&apos;s intended listing day, the Exchange expects the Restructure Security to be listed on an exchange or automatic quotation system that has, and is subject to, an initial listing requirement that is no less stringent that the Guideline in question.</p><p>(B) The Exchange may not rely on any such assumption, however, if a reasonable Exchange investigation or that of another exchange demonstrates that either the Share Guideline or Number of Shareholders Guideline will not in fact be satisfied on an option&apos;s intended listing date.</p><p>(C) In addition, in the case of a Restructuring Transaction in which the shares of a Restructure Security are issued or distributed to the holders of shares of an Original Equity Security, the Exchange may determine that either the Share Guideline or the Number of Shareholders Guideline is satisfied based upon the Exchange&apos;s knowledge of the outstanding shares or number of shareholders of the Original Equity Security.</p><p>(3) &#8220;Trading Volume&#8221; Guideline. In determining whether a Restructure Security that is issued or distributed to the holders of shares of an Original Equity Security (but not a Restructure Security that is issued pursuant to a public offering or rights distribution) satisfies the trading volume guideline set forth in Options 4, Section 3(b)(4) (the &#8220;Trading Volume Guideline&#8221;), the Exchange may consider the trading volume history of the Original Equity Security prior to the &#8220;ex-date&#8221; of the Restructuring Transaction if the Restructure Security satisfies the &#8220;Substantiality Test&#8221; set forth in subparagraph (c)(5) below.</p><p>(4) &#8220;Market Price&#8221; Guideline. In determining whether a Restructure Security satisfies the market price history guideline set forth in Options 4, Section 3(b)(5) (the &#8220;Market Price Guideline&#8221;), the Exchange may consider the market price history of the Original Equity Security prior to the &#8220;ex-date&#8221; of the Restructuring Transaction if:</p><p>(A) the Restructure Security satisfies the &#8220;Substantiality Test&#8221; set forth in subparagraph (c)(5) below; and</p><p>(B) in the case of the application of the Market Price Guideline to a Restructure Security that is distributed pursuant to a public offering or a rights distribution:</p><p>(i) the Restructure Security trades &#8220;regular way&#8221; on an exchange or automatic quotation system for at least the five trading days immediately preceding the date of selection; and</p><p>(ii) at the close of trading on each trading day on which the Restructure Security trades &#8220;regular way&#8221; prior to the date of selection, and the opening of trading on the date of selection, the market price of the Restructure Security was at least $7.50, or, if the Restructure Security is a &#8220;covered security,&#8221; as defined in Options 4, Section 3(b)(5)(I), the market price of the Restructure Security was at least $3.00.</p><p>(5) The &#8220;Substantiality Test.&#8221; A Restructure Security satisfies the &#8220;Substantiality Test&#8221; if:</p><p>(A) the Restructure Security has an aggregate market value of at least $500 million; or</p><p>(B) at least one of the following conditions is met:</p><p>(i) the aggregate market value of the Restructure Security equals or exceeds the Relevant Percentage of the aggregate market value of the Original Equity Security;</p><p>(ii) the aggregate book value of the assets attributed to the business represented by the Restructure Security equals or exceeds both $50 million and the Relevant Percentage of the aggregate book value of the assets attributed to the business represented by the Original Equity Security; or</p><p>(iii) the revenues attributed to the business represented by the Restructure Security equals or exceeds both $50 million and the Relevant Percentage of the revenues attributed to the business represented by the Original Equity Security.</p><p>(6) A Restructure Security&apos;s aggregate market value may be determined from &#8220;when issued&#8221; prices, if available.</p><p>(7) In calculating comparative aggregate market values for the purpose of assessing whether a Restructure Security qualifies to underlie an option, the Exchange shall use the Restructure Security&apos;s closing price on its primary market on the last business day prior to the selection date or the Restructure Security&apos;s opening price on its primary market on the selection date and shall use the corresponding closing or opening price of the related Original Equity Security.</p><p>(8) In calculating comparative asset values and revenues, the Exchange shall use (i) the issuer&apos;s latest annual financial statements or (ii) the issuer&apos;s most recently available interim financial statements (so long as such interim financial statements cover a period of not less than three months), whichever are more recent. Those financial statements may be audited or unaudited and may be pro forma.</p><p>(9) Except in the case of a Restructure Security that is distributed pursuant to a public offering or rights distribution, the Exchange may not rely upon the trading volume or market price history of an Original Equity Security as this paragraph (c) permits for any trading day unless it relies upon both of those measures for that trading day.</p><p>(10) Once the Exchange commences to rely upon a Restructure Security&apos;s trading volume and market price history for any trading day, the Exchange may not rely upon the trading volume and market price history of the security&apos;s related Original Equity Security for any trading day thereafter.</p><p>(11) &#8220;When Issued&#8221; Trading Prohibited.

The Exchange may list a strike price interval of $2.50 in any multiply-traded option once an exchange selects an option as part of the $2.50 Strike Price Program.</p><p>(h) The interval between strike prices of series of options on Fund Shares approved for options trading pursuant to Section 5(h) shall be fixed at a price per share which is reasonably close to the price per share at which the underlying security is traded in the primary market at or about the same time such series of options is first open for trading on the Exchange, or at such intervals as may have been established on another options exchange prior to the initiation of trading on the Exchange.</p>","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":456584,"ParentPartSourceId":"5eb72c85-8a7e-b42b-da63-75f351a4d9d1","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":393531,"LegislationSourceId":"da4047d0-c2a7-7152-d78f-8730e8178f10","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Nasdaq ise rules","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"c1b5f8c4-474a-4691-9d47-999dd90894ec","JurisdictionName":"United States of America","IssuingBodySourceId":"64fc69f7-e62e-46d2-a6f9-1d91d3c85d51","IssuingBodyName":"Nasdaq ISE","PartVersionId":4900380,"PartSourceId":"a5f2c010-7092-a564-f2e3-7fa60495df69","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":6,"Content":"<p>.01 $1 Strike Price Interval Program</p><p>(a) Program Description. The interval between strike prices of series of options on individual stocks may be $1.00 or greater strike price intervals where the strike price is $50.00 or less, but not less than $1. Except as provided in subparagraph (c) below, the listing of $1 strike price intervals shall be limited to options classes overlying no more than 150 individual stocks as specifically designated by the Exchange. The Exchange may list $1 strike price intervals on any other option classes if those classes are specifically designated by other securities exchanges that employ a $1 Strike Price Interval Program under their respective rules. If a class participates in the $1 Strike Price Interval Program, $2.50 strike price intervals are not permitted between $1 and $50 for non-LEAPS and LEAPs.</p><p>(b) Initial and Additional Series. To be eligible for inclusion into the $1 Strike Price Interval Program, an underlying stock must close below $50 in its primary market on the previous trading day. After a stock is added to the $1 Strike Price Interval Program, the Exchange may list $1 strike price intervals from $1 to $50 according to the following parameters:</p><p>(i) If the price of the underlying stock is equal to or less than $20, the Exchange may list series with an exercise price up to 100% above and 100% below the price of the underlying stock. However, the foregoing restriction shall not prohibit the listing of at least five (5) strike prices above and below the price of the underlying stock per expiration month in an option class. For example, if the price of the underlying stock is $2, the Exchange would be permitted to list the following series: $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6 and $7.</p><p>(ii) If the price of the underlying stock is greater than $20, the Exchange may list series with an exercise price up to 50% above and 50% below the price of the underlying security up to $50.</p><p>(iii) For the purpose of adding strikes under the $1 Strike Price Interval Program, the &#8220;price of the underlying stock&#8221; shall be measured in the same way as &#8220;the price of the underlying security&#8221; is as set forth in Options 4, Section 6(b)(i).</p><p>(iv) No additional series in $1 strike price intervals may be listed if the underlying stock closes at or above $50 in its primary market. Additional series in $1 strike price intervals may not be added until the underlying stock closes again below $50.</p><p>(v) LEAPS. For stocks in the $1 Strike Price Interval Program, the Exchange may list one $1 strike price interval between each standard $5 strike interval, with the $1 strike price interval being $2 above the standard strike for each interval above the price of the underlying stock, and $2 below the standard strike for each interval below the price of the underlying stock (&#8220;$2 wings&#8221;). For example, if the price of the underlying stock is $24.50, the Exchange may list the following standard strikes in $5 intervals: $15, $20, $25, $30 and $35. Between these standard $5 strikes, the Exchange may list the following $2 wings: $18, $27 and $32.</p><p>In addition, the Exchange may list the $1 strike price interval which is $2 above the standard strike just below the underlying price at the time of listing. In the above example, since the standard strike just below the underlying price ($24.50) is $20, the Exchange may list a $22 strike. The Exchange may add additional long-term options series strikes as the price of the underlying stock moves, consistent with the OLPP. Additional long-term option strikes may not be listed within $1 of an existing strike until less than nine months to expiration.</p><p>(c) The Exchange may list $1 strike prices up to $5 in LEAPS in up to 200 option classes on individual stocks. The Exchange may not list $1 strike price intervals within $0.50 of an existing $2.50 strike in the same expiration.</p><p>(d) Delisting Policy. For options classes selected to participate in the $1 Strike Price Interval Program, the Exchange will, on a monthly basis, review series that were originally listed under the $1 Strike Price Interval Program with strike prices that are more than $5 from the current value of an options class and delist those series with no open interest in both the put and the call series having a: (i) strike higher than the highest strike price with open interest in the put and/or call series for a given expiration month; and (ii) strike lower than the lowest strike price with open interest in the put and/or call series for a given expiration month.</p><p>If the Exchange identifies series for delisting pursuant to this policy, the Exchange shall notify other options exchanges with similar delisting policies regarding eligible series for delisting, and shall work jointly with such other exchanges to develop a uniform list of series to be delisted so as to ensure uniform series delisting of multiply listed options classes.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above delisting policy, Member requests to add strikes and/or maintain strikes in series of options classes traded pursuant to the $1 Strike Price Interval Program that are eligible for delisting may be granted.</p><p>(e) A stock shall remain in the $1 Strike Price Interval Program until otherwise designated by the Exchange.</p><p>.02 Short Term Option Series Program: After an option class has been approved for listing and trading on the Exchange, the Exchange may open for trading on any Thursday or Friday that is a business day (&#8220;Short Term Option Opening Date&#8221;) series of options on that class that expire at the close of business on each of the next five Fridays that are business days and are not Fridays in which monthly options series or Quarterly Options Series expire (&#8220;Short Term Option Expiration Dates&#8221;). The Exchange may have no more than a total of five Short Term Option Expiration Dates, not including any Monday or Wednesday SPY Expirations as provided below. If the Exchange is not open for business on the respective Thursday or Friday, the Short Term Option Opening Date will be the first business day immediately prior to that respective Thursday or Friday. Similarly, if the Exchange is not open for business on a Friday, the Short Term Option Expiration Date will be the first business day immediately prior to that Friday. With respect to Wednesday SPY Expirations, the Exchange may open for trading on any Tuesday or Wednesday that is a business day series of options on the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) to expire on any Wednesday of the month that is a business day and is not a Wednesday in which Quarterly Options Series expire (&#8220;Wednesday SPY Expirations&#8221;). With respect to Monday SPY Expirations, the Exchange may open for trading on any Friday or Monday that is a business day series of options on the SPY to expire on any Monday of the month that is a business day and is not a Monday in which Quarterly Options Series expire (&#8220;Monday SPY Expirations&#8221;), provided that Monday SPY Expirations that are listed on a Friday must be listed at least one business week and one business day prior to the expiration. The Exchange may list up to five consecutive Wednesday SPY Expirations and five consecutive Monday SPY Expirations at one time; the Exchange may have no more than a total of five Wednesday SPY Expirations and a total of five Monday SPY Expirations. Monday and Wednesday SPY Expirations will be subject to the provisions of this Rule. Regarding Short Term Option Series:</p><p>(a) Classes. The Exchange may select up to fifty (50) currently listed option classes on which Short Term Option Series may be opened on any Short Term Option Opening Date. In addition to the 50 option class restriction, the Exchange may also list Short Term Option Series on any option classes that are selected by other securities exchanges that employ a similar program under their respective rules. For each option class eligible for participation in the Short Term Option Series Program, the Exchange may open up to 30 Short Term Option Series for each expiration date in that class. The Exchange may also open Short Term Option Series that are opened by other securities exchanges in option classes selected by such exchanges under their respective short term option rules.</p><p>(b) Expiration. With the exception of Monday and Wednesday SPY Expirations, no Short Term Option Series may expire in the same week in which monthly option series on the same class expire. In the case of Quarterly Options Series, no Short Term Option Series may expire on the same day as an expiration of Quarterly Options Series.</p><p>(c) Initial Series. The Exchange may open up to 30 initial series for each option class that participates in the Short Term Option Series Program. The strike price of each Short Term Option Series will be fixed at a price per share, with approximately the same number of strike prices being opened above and below the value of the underlying security at about the time that the Short Term Option Series are initially opened for trading on the Exchange (e.g., if seven series are initially opened, there will be at least three strike prices above and three strike prices below the value of the underlying security). Any strike prices listed by the Exchange shall be reasonably close to the price of the underlying equity security and within the following parameters: (i) if the price of the underlying security is less than or equal to $20, strike prices shall be not more than one hundred percent (100%) above or below the price of the underlying security; and (ii) if the price of the underlying security is greater than $20, strike prices shall be not more than fifty percent (50%) above or below the price of the underlying security.</p><p>(d) Additional Series. If the Exchange opens less than thirty (30) Short Term Option Series for a Short Term Option Expiration Date, additional series may be opened for trading on the Exchange when the Exchange deems it necessary to maintain an orderly market, to meet customer demand or when the market price of the underlying security moves substantially from the exercise price or prices of the series already opened.</p><p>Any additional strike prices listed by the Exchange shall be reasonably close to the price of the underlying equity security and within the following parameters: (i) if the price of the underlying security is less than or equal to $20, additional strike prices shall be not more than one hundred percent (100%) above or below the price of the underlying security; and (ii) if the price of the underlying security is greater than $20, additional strike prices shall be not more than fifty percent (50%) above or below the price of the underlying security.</p><p>The Exchange may also open additional strike prices on Short Term Option Series that are more than 50% above or below the current price of the underlying security (if the price is greater than $20); provided that demonstrated customer interest exists for such series, as expressed by institutional, corporate or individual customers or their brokers. Market makers trading for their own account shall not be considered when determining customer interest under this provision.</p><p>In the event that the underlying security has moved such that there are no series that are at least 10% above or below the current price of the underlying security, the Exchange will delist any series with no open interest in both the call and the put series having a: (i) strike higher than the highest strike price with open interest in the put and/or call series for a given expiration week; and (ii) strike lower than the lowest strike price with open interest in the put and/or the call series for a given expiration week. The opening of new Short Term Option Series shall not affect the series of options of the same class previously opened. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Rule, Short Term Option Series may be added up to and including on the Short Term Option Expiration Date for that options series.</p><p>(e) Strike Interval. The interval between strike prices on Short Term Option Series shall be the same as the strike prices for series in that same option class that expire in accordance with the normal monthly expiration cycle. During the month prior to expiration of an option class that is selected for the Short Term Option Series Program pursuant to this Rule (&#8220;Short Term Option&#8221;), the strike price intervals for the related non-Short Term Option (&#8220;Related non-Short Term Option&#8221;) shall be the same as the strike price intervals for the Short Term Option.</p><p>.03 Quarterly Options Series Program: The Exchange may list and trade options series that expire at the close of business on the last business day of a calendar quarter (&#8220;Quarterly Options Series&#8221;). The Exchange may list Quarterly Options Series for up to five (5) currently listed options classes that are either index options or options on exchange traded funds (&#8220;ETFs&#8221;). In addition, the Exchange may also list Quarterly Options Series on any options classes that are selected by other securities exchanges that employ a similar program under their respective rules.</p><p>(a) Expiration. The Exchange may list series that expire at the end of the next consecutive four (4) calendar quarters, as well as the fourth quarter of the next calendar year.</p><p>(b) The Exchange will not list a Short Term Option Series on an options class whose expiration coincides with that of a Quarterly Options Series on that same options class.</p><p>(c) Initial Series. The strike price of each Quarterly Options Series will be fixed at a price per share, with at least two strike prices above and two strike prices below the approximate value of the underlying security at about the time that a Quarterly Options Series is opened for trading on the Exchange. The Exchange shall list strike prices for a Quarterly Options Series that are within $5 from the closing price of the underlying on the preceding day.</p><p>(d) Additional Series. Additional Quarterly Options Series of the same class may be opened for trading on the Exchange when the Exchange deems it necessary to maintain an orderly market, to meet customer demand or when the market price of the underlying security moves substantially from the initial exercise price or prices. To the extent that any additional strike prices are listed by the Exchange, such additional strike prices shall be within thirty percent (30%) above or below the closing price of the underlying ETF (or &#8220;Exchange-Traded Fund Shares&#8221;) as defined in Options 4, Section 3(h)) on the preceding day. The Exchange may also open additional strike prices of Quarterly Options Series in ETF options that are more than 30% above or below the current price of the underlying ETF provided that demonstrated customer interest exists for such series, as expressed by institutional, corporate or individual customers or their brokers. Market Makers trading for their own account shall not be considered when determining customer interest under this provision. The opening of new Quarterly Options Series shall not affect the series of options of the same class previously opened.</p><p>(e) Strike Interval. The interval between strike prices on Quarterly Options Series shall be the same as the interval for strike prices for series in that same options class that expire in accordance with the normal monthly expiration cycle.</p><p>(f) Reserved.</p><p>(g)</p><p>(i) Delisting Policy. With respect to Quarterly Options Series in ETF options added pursuant to the above paragraphs, the Exchange will, on a monthly basis, review series that are outside a range of five (5) strikes above and five (5) strikes below the current price of the underlying ETF, and delist series with no open interest in both the put and the call series having a: (1) strike higher than the highest strike price with open interest in the put and/or call series for a given expiration month; and (2) strike lower than the lowest strike price with open interest in the put and/or call series for a given expiration month.</p><p>(ii) Notwithstanding the above referenced delisting policy, customer requests to add strikes and/or maintain strikes in Quarterly Options Series in ETF options in series eligible for delisting shall be granted.</p><p>(iii) In connection with the above referenced delisting policy, if the Exchange identifies series for delisting, the Exchange shall notify other options exchanges with similar delisting policies regarding eligible series for delisting, and shall work with such other exchanges to develop a uniform list of series to be delisted, so as to ensure uniform series delisting of multiply listed Quarterly Options Series in ETF options.</p><p>.04 Notwithstanding Supplementary Material .01 above, the intervals between strike prices for Mini-Nasdaq-100 Index (&#8220;MNX&#8221; or &#8220;Mini-NDX&#8221;) options series shall be determined in accordance with Options4A, Section 12(c)(5).</p><p>.05 $0.50 Strike Program: The interval of strike prices of series of options on individual stocks may be $0.50 or greater beginning at $0.50 where the strike price is $5.50 or less, but only for options classes whose underlying security closed at or below $5.00 in its primary market on the previous trading day and which have national average daily volume that equals or exceeds 1000 contracts per day as determined by The Options Clearing Corporation during the preceding three calendar months. The listing of $0.50 strike prices shall be limited to options classes overlying no more than 20 individual stocks (the &#8220;$0.50 Strike Program&#8221;) as specifically designated by the Exchange. The Exchange may list $0.50 strike prices on any other option classes if those classes are specifically designated by other securities exchanges that employ a similar $0.50 Strike Program under their respective rules. A stock shall remain in the $0.50 Strike Program until otherwise designated by the Exchange.</p><p>.06 Notwithstanding Supplementary Material .01 above, the interval between strike prices of series of options on Index-Linked Securities, as defined in Options 4, Section 3(k)(1), will be $1 or greater when the strike price is $200 or less and $5 or greater when the strike price is greater than $200.</p><p>.07 Notwithstanding Supplementary Material .01 above, the interval between strike prices of series of options on Trust Issued Receipts, including Holding Company Depository Receipts (HOLDRs), will be $1 or greater where the strike price is $200 or less and $5 or greater where the strike price is greater than $200.</p><p>.08 Reserved.</p><p>.09 $5 Strike Program: The interval of strike prices may be $5 or greater where the strike price is more than $200 in up to five (5) option classes on individual stocks or on any other option classes if those classes are specifically designated by other securities exchanges that employ a similar $5 Strike Program under their respective rules.</p><p>.10 Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in this Rule and any Supplementary Material thereto, the Exchange may list additional expiration months on options classes opened for trading on the Exchange if such expiration months are opened for trading on at least one other registered national securities exchange.</p><p>.11 $0.50 and $1.00 Strike Price Intervals for Options Used to Calculate Volatility Indexes. Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in Section 5(g) and Supplementary Material .01, .06, and .07 above, the Exchange may open for trading series at $0.50 or greater strike price intervals where the strike price is less than $75 and $1.00 or greater strike price intervals where the strike price is between $75 and $150 for options that are used to calculate a volatility index.</p><p>.12 Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in this Rule and any Supplementary Material thereto, the Exchange may open for trading Short Term Option Series on the Short Term Option Opening Date that expire on the Short Term Option Expiration Date at strike price intervals of (i) $0.50 or greater where the strike price is less than $100, and $1 or greater where the strike price is between $100 and $150 for all option classes that participate in the Short Term Options Series Program; (ii) $0.50 for option classes that trade in one dollar increments and are in the Short Term Option Series Program; or (iii) $2.50 or greater where the strike price is above $150.</p><p>.13 Mini Option Contracts.</p><p>(a) After an option class on a stock, Exchange-Traded Fund Share, Trust Issued Receipt, Exchange Traded Note, and other Index Linked Security with a 100 share deliverable has been approved for listing and trading on the Exchange, series of option contracts with a 10 share deliverable on that stock, Exchange-Traded Fund Share, Trust Issued Receipt, Exchange Traded Note, and other Index Linked Security may be listed for all expirations opened for trading on the Exchange. Mini Option contracts may currently be listed on SPDR S&amp;P 500 (&#8220;SPY&#8221;), Apple Inc. (&#8220;AAPL&#8221;), SPDR Gold Trust (&#8220;GLD&#8221;), Google Inc. (&#8220;GOOGL&#8221;) and<url link=\"http://Amazon.com\">Amazon.com</url>Inc. (&#8220;AMZN&#8221;).</p><p>(b) Strike prices for Mini Options shall be set at the same level as for regular options. For example, a call series strike price to deliver 10 shares of stock at $125 per share has a total deliverable value of $1250, and the strike price will be set at 125.</p><p>(c) No additional series of Mini Options may be added if the underlying security is trading at $90 or less. The underlying security must trade above $90 for five consecutive days prior to listing Mini Options contracts in an additional expiration month.</p><p>(d) The minimum trading increment for Mini Options shall be the same as the minimum trading increment permitted for standard options on the same underlying security. For example, if a security participates in the Penny Pilot Program, Mini Options in the same underlying security may be quoted and traded in the same minimum increments, e.g., $0.01 for all quotations in series that are quoted at less than $3 per contract and $0.05 for all quotations in series that are quoted at $3 per contract or greater, $0.01 for all SPY option series.</p><p>(e) Exchange Rules that have a minimum contract threshold shall be adjusted for Mini Options by a multiple of ten (10) and shall be as follows: (i) a block-size order in Mini Options for execution in the Block Order Mechanism must be for 500 or more Mini Option contracts; (ii) Mini Options executed in the Solicited Order Mechanism must be for 5,000 or more Mini Option contracts; and (iii) a Qualified Contingent Cross Order in Mini Options must be comprised of an originating order to buy or sell at least 10,000 Mini Option contracts coupled with a contra-side order or orders totaling an equal number of Mini Option contracts.</p><p>.14 Notwithstanding any other provision regarding the interval of strike prices of series of options on Exchange-Traded Fund Shares in this Rule, the interval of strike prices on SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (&#8220;SPY&#8221;), iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (&#8220;IVV&#8221;), PowerShares QQQ Trust (&#8220;QQQ&#8221;), iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund (&#8220;IWM&#8221;), and the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (&#8220;DIA&#8221;) options will be $1 or greater.</p><p>[Adopted June 6, 2019 (SR-ISE-2019-17).]</p>","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":456584,"ParentPartSourceId":"5eb72c85-8a7e-b42b-da63-75f351a4d9d1","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":393531,"LegislationSourceId":"da4047d0-c2a7-7152-d78f-8730e8178f10","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Nasdaq ise rules","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"c1b5f8c4-474a-4691-9d47-999dd90894ec","JurisdictionName":"United States of America","IssuingBodySourceId":"64fc69f7-e62e-46d2-a6f9-1d91d3c85d51","IssuingBodyName":"Nasdaq ISE","PartVersionId":456619,"PartSourceId":"abfabd12-dadc-afc5-ca25-48e83b405685","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":7,"Content":"<p>(a) The provisions set forth in this Rule were adopted by the Exchange as a quote mitigation strategy and are codified in the OLPP.

The broad-based index hedge exemption is in addition to the other exemptions available under Exchange Rules, interpretations and policies. The following procedures and criteria must be satisfied to qualify for a broad-based index hedge exemption:</p><p>(1) The account in which the exempt options positions are held (&#8220;hedge exemption account&#8221;) must have received prior Exchange approval for the hedge exemption specifying the maximum number of contracts that may be exempt under this Rule. The hedge exemption account must have provided all information required on Exchange-approved forms and must have kept such information current. Exchange approval may be granted on the basis of verbal representations, in which event the hedge exemption account shall within two business days, or such other time period designated by the Exchange, furnish the Exchange with appropriate forms and documentation substantiating the basis for the exemption. The hedge exemption account may apply from time to time for an increase in the maximum number of contracts exempt from the position limits.</p><p>(2) A hedge exemption account that is not carried by a Member must be carried by a Member of a self-regulatory organization participating in the Intermarket Surveillance Group.</p><p>(3) The hedge exemption account maintains a qualified portfolio, or will effect transactions necessary to obtain a qualified portfolio concurrent with or at or about the same time as the execution of the exempt options positions, of:</p><p>(i) a net long or short position in common stocks in at least four industry groups and contains at least twenty (20) stocks, none of which accounts for more than fifteen percent (15%) of the value of the portfolio or in securities readily convertible, and additionally in the case of convertible bonds economically convertible, into common stocks which would comprise a portfolio; or</p><p>(ii) a net long or short position in index futures contracts or in options on index futures contracts, or long or short positions in index options or index warrants, for which the underlying index is included in the same margin or cross-margin product group cleared at the Clearing Corporation as the index options class to which the hedge exemption applies.</p><p>To remain qualified, a portfolio must at all times meet these standards notwithstanding trading activity.</p><p>(4) The exemption applies to positions in broad-based index options dealt in on the Exchange and is applicable to the unhedged value of the qualified portfolio. The unhedged value will be determined as follows:</p><p>(i) the values of the net long or short positions of all qualifying products in the portfolio are totaled;</p><p>(ii) for positions in excess of the standard limit, the underlying market value (A) of any economically equivalent opposite side of the market calls and puts in broad-based index options, and (B) of any opposite side of the market positions in stock index futures, options on stock index futures, and any economically equivalent opposite side of the market positions, assuming no other hedges for these contracts exist, is subtracted from the qualified portfolio; and</p><p>(iii) the market value of the resulting unhedged portfolio is equated to the appropriate number of exempt contracts as follows: the unhedged qualified portfolio is divided by the correspondent closing index value and the quotient is then divided by the index multiplier or 100.</p><p>(5) Positions in broad-based index options that are traded on the Exchange are exempt from the standard limits to the extent specified below.</p><table><tr><th><p>Broad-Based Index Option Type</p></th><th><p>Broad-Based Index Hedge Exemption (is in addition to standard limit)</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>Broad-based indexes other than for those that do not have any position limits</p></td><td><p>75,000</p></td></tr></table><p>(6) Only the following qualified hedging transactions and positions are eligible for purposes of hedging a qualified portfolio (i.e. stocks, futures, options and warrants) pursuant to this Rule:</p><p>(i) Long put(s) used to hedge the holdings of a qualified portfolio;</p><p>(ii) Long call(s) used to hedge a short position in a qualified portfolio;</p><p>(iii) Short call(s) used to hedge the holdings of a qualified portfolio; and</p><p>(iv) Short put(s) used to hedge a short position in a qualified portfolio.</p><p>The following strategies may be effected only in conjunction with a qualified stock portfolio for non-P.M. settled, European style index options only:</p><p>(v) A short call position accompanied by long put(s), where the short call(s) expires with the long put(s), and the strike price of the short call(s) equals or exceeds the strike price of the long put(s)(a &#8220;collar&#8221;). Neither side of the collar transaction can be in-the-money at the time the position is established. For purposes of determining compliance with Options 9, Section 12 and this Options 4A, Section 9, a collar position will be treated as one contract;</p><p>(vi) A long put position coupled with a short put position overlying the same broad-based index and having an equivalent underlying aggregate index value, where the short put(s) expires with the long put(s), and the strike price of the long put(s) exceeds the strike price of the short put(s)(a &#8220;debit put spread position&#8221;); and</p><p>(vii) A short call position accompanied by a debit put spread position, where the short call(s) expires with the puts and the strike price of the short call(s) equals or exceeds the strike price of the long put(s). Neither side of the short call, long put transaction can be in-the-money at the time the position is established. For purposes of determining compliance with Options 9, Section 13 and this Options 4A, Section 9, the short call and long put positions will be treated as one contract.</p><p>(7) The hedge exemption account shall:</p><p>(i) liquidate and establish options, stock positions, their equivalent or other qualified portfolio products in an orderly fashion; not initiate or liquidate positions in a manner calculated to cause unreasonable price fluctuations or unwarranted price changes; and not initiate or liquidate a stock position or its equivalent with an equivalent index options position with a view toward taking advantage of any differential in price between a group of securities and an overlying stock index option;</p><p>(ii) liquidate any options prior to or contemporaneously with a decrease in the hedged value of the qualified portfolio which options would thereby be rendered excessive; and</p><p>(iii) promptly notify the Exchange of any material change in the qualified portfolio which materially affects the unhedged value of the qualified portfolio.</p><p>(8) If an exemption is granted, it will be effective at the time the decision is communicated. Retroactive exemptions will not be granted.</p><p>(9) The hedge exemption account shall promptly provide to the Exchange any information requested concerning the qualified portfolio.</p><p>(10) Positions included in a qualified portfolio that serve to secure an index hedge exemption may not also be used to secure any other position limit exemption granted by the Exchange or any other self regulatory organization or futures contract market.</p><p>(11) Any Member that maintains a broad-based index options position in such Member&apos;s own account or in a customer account, and has reason to believe that such position is in excess of the applicable limit, shall promptly take the action necessary to bring the position into compliance. Failure to abide by this provision shall be deemed to be a violation of Options 9, Section 13 and this Options 4A, Section 9 by the Member.</p><p>(12) Violation of any of the provisions of this Rule, absent reasonable justification or excuse, shall result in withdrawal of the index hedge exemption and may form the basis for subsequent denial of an application for an index hedge exemption hereunder.</p><p>(13) Each Member (other than Exchange market-makers) that maintains a broad-based index option position on the same side of the market in excess of 100,000 contracts in NDX or RUT for its own account or for the account of a customer, shall report information as to whether the positions are hedged and provide documentation as to how such contracts are hedged, in the manner and form required by the Exchange. In calculating the applicable contract-reporting amount, reduced-value contracts will be aggregated with full-value contracts and counted by the amount by which they equal a full-value contract (e.g., 10 MNX options equal 1 NDX full-value contract). The Exchange may impose other reporting requirements as well as the limit at which the reporting requirement may be triggered.</p><p>(14) Whenever the Exchange determines that additional margin is warranted in light of the risks associated with an under-hedged NDX or RUT options position, the Exchange may impose additional margin upon the account maintaining such under-hedged position pursuant to its authority under Options 6C, Section 5. The clearing firm carrying the account also will be subject to capital charges under Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act to the extent of any margin deficiency resulting from the higher margin requirements.</p><p>(b) Industry Index Hedge Exemption. The industry (narrow-based) index hedge exemption is in addition to the other exemptions available under Exchange Rules, interpretations and policies, and may not exceed twice the standard limit established under Options 4A, Section 7. Industry index options positions may be exempt from established position limits for each options contract &#8220;hedged&#8221; by an equivalent dollar amount of the underlying component securities or securities convertible into such components; provided that, in applying such hedge, each options position to be exempted is hedged by a position in at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the number of component securities underlying the index. In addition, the underlying value of the options position may not exceed the value of the underlying portfolio. The value of the underlying portfolio is: (1) the total market value of the net stock position; and (2) for positions in excess of the standard limit, subtract the underlying market value of: (i) any offsetting calls and puts in the respective index option; (ii) any offsetting positions in related stock index futures or options; and (iii) any economically equivalent positions (assuming no other hedges for these contracts exist). The following procedures and criteria must be satisfied to qualify for an industry index hedge exemption:</p><p>(1) The hedge exemption account must have received prior Exchange approval for the hedge exemption specifying the maximum number of contracts that may be exempt under this Interpretation. The hedge exemption account must have provided all information required on Exchange-approved forms and must have kept such information current. Exchange approval may be granted on the basis of verbal representations, in which event the hedge exemption account shall within two business days, or such other time period designated by the Exchange, furnish the Exchange with appropriate forms and documentation substantiating the basis for the exemption. The hedge exemption account may apply from time to time for an increase in the maximum number of contracts exempt from the position limits.</p><p>(2) A hedge exemption account that is not carried by a Member must be carried by a Member of a self-regulatory organization participating in the Intermarket Surveillance Group.</p><p>(3) The hedge exemption account: shall liquidate and establish options, stock positions, or economically equivalent positions in an orderly fashion; shall not initiate or liquidate positions in a manner calculated to cause unreasonable price fluctuations or unwarranted price changes; and shall not initiate or liquidate a stock position or its equivalent with an equivalent index options position with a view toward taking advantage of any differential in price between a group of securities and an overlying stock index option. The hedge exemption account shall liquidate any options prior to or contemporaneously with a decrease in the hedged value of the portfolio which options would thereby be rendered excessive. The hedge exemption account shall promptly notify the Exchange of any change in the portfolio which materially affects the unhedged value of the portfolio.</p><p>(4) If an exemption is granted, it will be effective at the time the decision is communicated. Retroactive exemptions will not be granted.</p><p>(5) The hedge exemption account shall promptly provide to the Exchange any information requested concerning the portfolio.</p><p>(6) Positions included in a portfolio that serve to secure an index hedge exemption may not also be used to secure any other position limit exemption granted by the Exchange or any other self regulatory organization or futures contract market.</p><p>(7) Any Member that maintains an industry index options position in such Member&apos;s own account or in a customer account, and has reason to believe that such position is in excess of the applicable limit, shall promptly take the action necessary to bring the position into compliance. Failure to abide by this provision shall be deemed to be a violation of Options 9, Section 13 and this Options 4A, Section 9by the Member.</p><p>(8) Violation of any of the provisions of this Options 4A, Section 9, absent reasonable justification or excuse, shall result in withdrawal of the index hedge exemption and may form the basis for subsequent denial of an application for an index hedge exemption hereunder.</p><p>(c) Exemptions Granted by Other Options Exchanges - A Member may rely upon any available exemptions from applicable position limits granted from time to time by another options exchange for any options contract traded on the Exchange provided that such Member:</p><p>(1) provides the Exchange with a copy of any written exemption issued by another options exchange or a written description of any exemption issued by another options exchange other than in writing containing sufficient detail for Exchange regulatory staff to verify the validity of that exemption with the issuing options exchange, and</p><p>(2) fulfills all conditions precedent for such exemption and complies at all times with the requirements of such exemption with respect to the Member&apos;s trading on the Exchange.</p><p>(d) Delta-Based Index hedge Exemption. The Delta-Based Index Hedge Exemption is in addition to the standard limit and other exemptions available under Exchange Rules. An index option position of a Member or non-Member affiliate of a Member that is delta neutral shall be exempt from established position limits as prescribed under Options 4A, Sections 6 and 7, subject to the following:</p><p>(1) The term &#8220;delta neutral&#8221; refers to an index option position that is hedged, in accordance with a permitted pricing model, by a position in one or more correlated instruments, for the purpose of offsetting the risk that the value of the option position will change with incremental changes in the value of the underlying index. The term &#8220;correlated instruments&#8221; means securities and/or other instruments that track the performance of or are based on the same underlying index as the index underlying the option position (but not including baskets of securities).</p><p>(2) An index option position that is not delta neutral shall be subject to position limits in accordance with Options 4A, Sections 6 and 7 (subject to the availability of other position limit exemptions). Only the options contract equivalent of the net delta of such position shall be subject to the appropriate position limit. The &#8220;options contract equivalent of the net delta&#8221; is the net delta divided by units of trade that equate to one option contract on a delta basis. The term &#8220;net delta&#8221; means, at any time, the number of shares and/or other units of trade (either long or short) required to offset the risk that the value of an index option position will change with incremental changes in the value of the underlying index, as determined in accordance with a permitted pricing model.</p><p>(3) A &#8220;permitted pricing model&#8221; shall have the meaning as defined in Options 9, Section 14(a)(7)(C).</p><p>(4) Effect on Aggregation of Accounts</p><p>(i) Members and non-Member affiliates who rely on this exemption must ensure that the permitted pricing model is applied to all positions in correlated instruments that are owned or controlled by such Member or non-Member affiliate.</p><p>(ii) Notwithstanding subparagraph (iv)(1), the net delta of an option position held by an entity entitled to rely on this exemption, or by a separate and distinct trading unit of such entity, may be calculated without regard to positions in correlated instruments held by an affiliated entity or by another trading unit within the same entity, provided that:</p><p>(A) the entity demonstrates to the Exchange&apos;s satisfaction that no control relationship, as defined in Options 9, Section 13(f), exists between such affiliates or trading units*; and</p><p>(B) the entity has provided (by the Member carrying the account as applicable) the Exchange written notice in advance that it intends to be considered separate and distinct from any affiliate or, as applicable, which trading units within the entity are to be considered separate and distinct from each other for purposes of this exemption.</p><p>(5) Notwithstanding subparagraph (iv)(1) or (iv)(2), a Member or non-Member affiliate who relies on this exemption shall designate, by prior written notice to the Exchange (to be obtained and provided by the Member carrying the account as applicable), each trading unit or entity whose option positions are required under Exchange Rules to be aggregated with the option positions of such Member or non-Member affiliate that is relying on this exemption for purposes of compliance with Exchange position limits or exercise limits. In any such case:</p><p>(1) the permitted pricing model shall be applied, for purposes of calculating such Member&apos;s or affiliate&apos;s net delta, only to the positions in correlated instruments owned and controlled by those entities and trading units who are relying on this exemption; and</p><p>(2) the net delta of the positions owned or controlled by the entities and trading units who are relying on this exemption shall be aggregated with the non-exempt option positions of all other entities and trading units whose options positions are required under Exchange Rules to be aggregated with the option positions of such Member or affiliate.</p><p>(6) Obligations of Members</p><p>(1) A Member that relies on this exemption for a proprietary index options position:</p><p>(A) must provide a written certification to the Exchange that it is using a permitted pricing model pursuant to subparagraph (iii) above; and</p><p>(B) by such reliance authorizes any other person carrying for such Member an account including, or with whom such Member has entered into, a position in a correlated instrument to provide to the Exchange or the Options Clearing Corporation such information regarding such account or position as the Exchange or Options Clearing Corporation may request as part of the Exchange&apos;s confirmation or verification of the accuracy of any net delta calculation under this exemption.</p><p>(2) The index option positions of a non-Member relying on this exemption must be carried by a Member with which it is affiliated.</p><p>(3) A Member carrying an account that includes an index option position for a non-Member affiliate that intends to rely on this exemption must obtain from such non-Member affiliate and must provide to the Exchange.</p><p>(A) a written certification to the Exchange that the non-Member affiliate is using a permitted pricing model pursuant to subparagraph (iii) above; and</p><p>(B) a written statement confirming that such non-Member affiliate:</p><p>(i) is relying on this exemption;</p><p>(ii) will use only a permitted pricing model for purposes of calculating the net delta of its option positions for purposes of this exemption;</p><p>(iii) will promptly notify the Member if it ceases to rely on this exemption;</p><p>(iv) authorizes the Member to provide to the Exchange or the Options Clearing Corporation such information regarding positions of the non-Member affiliate as the Exchange or Options Clearing Corporation may request as part of the Exchange&apos;s confirmation or verification of the accuracy of any net delta calculation under this exemption; and</p><p>(e) if the non-Member affiliate is using the OCC Model, has duly executed and delivered to the Member such documents as the Exchange may require to be executed and delivered to the Exchange as a condition to reliance on this exemption.</p><p>(7) Reporting. Each Member (other than an Exchange Market Maker using the OCC Model) that holds or carries an account that relies on this exemption shall report, in accordance with Options 9, Section 16, all index option positions (including those that are delta neutral) that are reportable thereunder. Each such Member on its own behalf or on behalf of a designated aggregation unit pursuant to Options 4A, Section 9(c)(iv) shall also report, in accordance with Exchange Options 9, Section 16 for each such account that holds an index option position subject to this exemption in excess of the levels specified in Options 4A, Section 6 and 7, the net delta and the options contract equivalent of the net delta of such position.</p><p>(8) Records. Each Member relying on this exemption shall: (i) retain, and undertake reasonable efforts to ensure that any non-Member affiliate of the Member relying on this exemption retains, a list of the options, securities and other instruments underlying each option position net delta calculation reported to the Exchange hereunder, and (ii) produce such information to the Exchange upon request.</p><p>[Adopted June 6, 2019 (SR-ISE-2019-17).]</p>","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":456655,"ParentPartSourceId":"b9e4b435-95fe-1bfb-40a6-2c6169638bd8","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":393531,"LegislationSourceId":"da4047d0-c2a7-7152-d78f-8730e8178f10","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Nasdaq ise rules","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"c1b5f8c4-474a-4691-9d47-999dd90894ec","JurisdictionName":"United States of America","IssuingBodySourceId":"64fc69f7-e62e-46d2-a6f9-1d91d3c85d51","IssuingBodyName":"Nasdaq ISE","PartVersionId":4900384,"PartSourceId":"215a0f53-6aed-8670-cae3-41a46dc45d1c","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":10,"Content":"<p>(a) In determining compliance with Options 9, Section 15, exercise limits for index options contracts, including for options on a Foreign Currency Index, shall be equivalent to the position limits prescribed for options contracts with the nearest expiration date in Options 4A, Sections 6, 7 or 8.

Except as otherwise provided in this Rule or under unusual conditions as may be determined by the President or his designee, transactions in index options, including Foreign Currency Index options, may be effected on the Exchange between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 4:15 p.m. Eastern time, except that that on the last trading day, transactions in expiring p.m.-settled broad-based index options may be effected on the Exchange between the hours of 9:30 a.m. (Eastern time) and 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time). With respect to options on foreign indexes, an Exchange official designated by the Board shall determine the days and hours of business.</p><p>(b) Trading Rotations. The opening rotation for index options shall be held at or as soon as practicable after 9:30 a.m. Eastern time. An Exchange official designated by the Board may delay the commencement of the opening rotation in an index option whenever in the judgment of that official such action is appropriate in the interests of a fair and orderly market. Among the factors that may be considered in making these determinations are: (1) unusual conditions or circumstances in other markets; (2) an influx of orders that has adversely affected the ability of the Primary Market Maker to provide and to maintain fair and orderly markets; (3) activation of opening price limits in stock index futures on one or more futures exchanges; (4) activation of daily price limits in stock index futures on one or more futures exchanges; (5) the extent to which either there has been a delay in opening or trading is not occurring in stocks underlying the index; and (6) circumstances such as those which would result in the declaration of a fast market under Options 2, Section 5(d).</p><p>(c) Instituting Halts and Suspensions. Trading on the Exchange in any index option shall be halted or suspended whenever trading in underlying securities whose weighted value represents more than twenty percent (20%), in the case of a broad based index, and ten percent (10%) for all other indices, of the index value is halted or suspended. An Exchange official designated by the Board also may halt trading in an index option, including in options on a Foreign Currency Index, when, in his or her judgment, such action is appropriate in the interests of a fair and orderly market and to protect investors. Among the facts that may be considered are the following:</p><p>(1) whether all trading has been halted or suspended in the market that is the primary market for a plurality of the underlying stocks, or in the case of a Foreign Currency Index, in the underlying foreign currency market;</p><p>(2) whether the current calculation of the index derived from the current market prices of the stocks is not available, or in the case of the a Foreign Currency Index, the current prices of the underlying foreign currency is not available;</p><p>(3) the extent to which the rotation has been completed or other factors regarding the status of the rotation; and</p><p>(4) other unusual conditions or circumstances detrimental to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market are present, including, but not limited to, the activation of price limits on futures exchanges.</p><p>(d) Resumption of Trading Following a Halt or Suspension. Trading in options of a class or series that has been the subject of a halt or suspension by the Exchange may resume if an Exchange official designated by the Board determines that the interests of a fair and orderly market are served by a resumption of trading. Among the factors to be considered in making this determination are whether the conditions that led to the halt or suspension are no longer present, and the extent to which trading is occurring in stocks or currencies underlying an index. Upon reopening, a rotation shall be held in each class of index options unless an Exchange official designated by the Board concludes that a different method of reopening is appropriate under the circumstances, including but not limited to, no rotation, an abbreviated rotation or any other variation in the manner of the rotation.</p><p>(e) Circuit Breakers.

When the primary market for a security underlying the current index value of an index option does not open for trading on a given day, which is an expiration day, for the purposes of calculating the settlement price at expiration, the last reported sale price of the security from the previous trading day shall be used.

fifth business day prior to expiration.</p><p>(3) When new series of index options with a new expiration date are opened for trading, or when additional series of index options in an existing expiration date are opened for trading as the current value of the underlying index to which such series relate moves substantially from the exercise prices of series already opened, the exercise prices of such new or additional series shall be reasonably related to the current value of the underlying index at the time such series are first opened for trading. In the case of all classes of index options, the term &#8220;reasonably related to the current value of the underlying index&#8221; shall have the meaning set forth in paragraph (c)(4) below.</p><p>(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (c), the Exchange may open for trading additional series of the same class of index options as the current index value of the underlying index moves substantially from the exercise price of those index options that already have been opened for trading on the Exchange. The exercise price of each series of index options opened for trading on the Exchange shall be reasonably related to the current index value of the underlying index to which such series relates at or about the time such series of options is first opened for trading on the Exchange. The term &#8220;reasonably related to the current index value of the underlying index&#8221; means that the exercise price is within thirty percent (30%) of the current index value. The Exchange may also open for trading additional series of index options that are more than thirty percent (30%) away from the current index value, provided that demonstrated customer interest exists for such series, as expressed by institutional, corporate, or individual customers or their brokers.

The Exchange may list series at $1 or greater strike price intervals for Mini-NDX or NQX options, and will list at least two strike prices above and two strike prices below the current value of MNX or NQX at about the time a series is opened for trading on the Exchange. The Exchange shall list strike prices for Mini-NDX or NQX options that are within 5 points from the closing value of MNX or NQX on the preceding day.</p><p>(ii) Additional Series. Additional series of the same class of Mini-NDX or NQX options may be opened for trading on the Exchange when the Exchange deems it necessary to maintain an orderly market, to meet customer demand or when the underlying MNX or NQX moves substantially from the initial exercise price or prices. To the extent that any additional strike prices are listed by the Exchange, such additional strike prices shall be within thirty percent (30%) above or below the closing value of MNX or NQX. The Exchange may also open additional strike prices that are more than 30% above or below the current MNX or NQX value provided that demonstrated customer interest exists for such series, as expressed by institutional, corporate or individual customers or their brokers. Market-Makers trading for their own account shall not be considered when determining customer interest under this provision. In addition to the initial listed series, the Exchange may list up to sixty (60) additional series per expiration month for each series in Mini-NDX or NQX options.</p><p>(iii) The Exchange shall not list LEAPS on Mini-NDX or NQX options at intervals less than $5.</p><p>(iv)</p><p>(A) Delisting Policy. With respect to Mini-NDX or NQX options added pursuant to the above paragraphs, the Exchange will, on a monthly basis, review series that are outside a range of five (5) strikes above and five (5) strikes below the current value of MNX or NQX, and delist series with no open interest in both the put and the call series having a: (i) strike higher than the highest strike price with open interest in the put and/or call series for a given expiration month; and (ii) strike lower than the lowest strike price with open interest in the put and/or call series for a given expiration month.</p><p>(B) Notwithstanding the above referenced delisting policy, Customer requests to add strikes and/or maintain strikes in Mini-NDX or NQX option series eligible for delisting shall be granted.</p><p>(C) In connection with the above referenced delisting policy, if the Exchange identifies series for delisting, the Exchange shall notify other options exchanges with similar delisting policies regarding eligible series for delisting, and shall work with such other exchanges to develop a uniform list of series to be delisted, so as to ensure uniform series delisting of multiply listed Mini-NDX or NQX options.</p><p>(6) Notwithstanding Options 4A, Section 12(c)(1), the interval between strike prices of series of options on the KBW Bank Index (&#8220;BKX&#8221;) will be $1 or greater, subject to following conditions:</p><p>(i) Initial Series. The Exchange may list series at $1 or greater strike price intervals for BKX options, if the strike price is less than $200, and will list at least two strike prices above and two strike prices below the current value of BKX at about the time a series is opened for trading on the Exchange. The Exchange shall list strike prices for BKX options that are within 5 points from the closing value of BKX on the preceding day.</p><p>(ii) Additional Series. Additional series of the same class of BKX options may be opened for trading on the Exchange when the Exchange deems it necessary to maintain an orderly market, to meet customer demand or when the underlying BKX moves substantially from the initial exercise price or prices. To the extent that any additional strike prices are listed by the Exchange, such additional strike prices shall be within thirty percent (30%) above or below the closing value of BKX. The Exchange may also open additional strike prices that are more than 30% above or below the current BKX value provided that demonstrated customer interest exists for such series, as expressed by institutional, corporate or individual customers or their brokers. Market-Makers trading for their own account shall not be considered when determining customer interest under this provision. In addition to the initial listed series, the Exchange may list up to sixty (60) additional series per expiration month for each series in BKX options. In all cases, however, the $1 strike price interval may be listed on BKX options only where the strike price is less than $200.</p><p>(iii) The Exchange shall not list LEAPS on BKX options at intervals less than $2.50.</p><p>(iv)</p><p>(A) Delisting Policy. With respect to BKX options added pursuant to the above paragraphs, the Exchange will regularly review series that are outside a range of five (5) strikes above and five (5) strikes below the current value of BKX, and may delist series with no open interest in both the put and the call series having a: (i) strike higher than the highest strike price with open interest in the put and/or call series for a given expiration month; and (ii) strike lower than the lowest strike price with open interest in the put and/or call series for a given expiration month.</p><p>(B) Notwithstanding the above referenced delisting policy, Customer requests to add strikes and/or maintain strikes in BKX options eligible for delisting shall be granted.</p><p>(C) In connection with the above referenced delisting policy, if the Exchange identifies series for delisting, the Exchange shall notify other options exchanges with similar delisting policies regarding eligible series for delisting, and shall work with such other exchanges to develop a uniform list of series to be delisted, so as to ensure uniform series delisting of multiply listed BKX options.</p><p>(7) Notwithstanding Options 4A, Section 12(c)(1), (c)(3) and (c)(4), the interval between strike prices for options on the Nations VolDex Index (&#8220;VolDex&#8221;) will be $1 or greater where the strike price is $200 or less and $5 or greater where the strike price is greater than $200.</p><p>(d) Index Level on the Last Day of Trading. The reported level of the underlying index that is calculated by the reporting authority on the business day of expiration, or, in the case of an option contract expiring on a day that is not a business day, the last day of trading in the underlying securities prior to the expiration date for purposes of determining the current index value at the expiration of an A.M.-settled index option may differ from the level of the index that is separately calculated and reported by the reporting authority and that reflects trading activity subsequent to the opening of trading in any of the underlying securities.</p><p>(e) Index Values for Settlement. The Rules of the Clearing Corporation specify that, unless the Rules of the Exchange provide otherwise, the current index value used to settle the exercise of an index options contract shall be the closing index for the day on which the index options contract is exercised in accordance with the Rules of the Clearing Corporation or, if such day is not a business day, for the most recent business day.</p><p>(1) The closing settlement value for options on a Foreign Currency Index shall be determined by using the WM Intra-Day Spot rate on the last trading day during expiration week.</p>","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":456655,"ParentPartSourceId":"b9e4b435-95fe-1bfb-40a6-2c6169638bd8","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":393531,"LegislationSourceId":"da4047d0-c2a7-7152-d78f-8730e8178f10","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Nasdaq ise rules","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"c1b5f8c4-474a-4691-9d47-999dd90894ec","JurisdictionName":"United States of America","IssuingBodySourceId":"64fc69f7-e62e-46d2-a6f9-1d91d3c85d51","IssuingBodyName":"Nasdaq ISE","PartVersionId":4900387,"PartSourceId":"2185af60-26fe-e632-8c76-789e9cace673","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":13,"Content":"<p>.01 Short Term Option Series Program: Notwithstanding the restriction in Options 4A, Section 12(a)(3), after an option class has been approved for listing and trading on the Exchange, the Exchange may open for trading on any Thursday or Friday that is a business day (&#8220;Short Term Option Opening Date&#8221;) series of options on that class that expire at the close of business on each of the next five Fridays that are business days and are not Fridays in which monthly options series or Quarterly Options Series expire (&#8220;Short Term Option Expiration Dates&#8221;). The Exchange may have no more than a total of five Short Term Option Expiration Dates. If the Exchange is not open for business on the respective Thursday or Friday, the Short Term Option Opening Date will be the first business day immediately prior to that respective Thursday or Friday.

In addition to the 30 option class restriction, the Exchange may also list Short Term Option Series on any option classes that are selected by other securities exchanges that employ a similar program under their respective rules. For each index option class eligible for participation in the Short Term Option Series Program, the Exchange may open up to 30 Short Term Option Series on index options for each expiration date in that class. The Exchange may also open Short Term Option Series that are opened by other securities exchanges in option classes selected by such exchanges under their respective short term option rules.</p><p>(b) Expiration.

The Exchange may open up to 20 initial series for each option class that participates in the Short Term Option Series Program. The strike price of each Short Term Option Series will be fixed at a price per share, with approximately the same number of strike prices above and below the calculated index value of the underlying index at about the time that Short Term Option Series are initially opened for trading on the Exchange (e.g., if seven series are initially opened, there will be at least three strike prices above and three strike prices below the calculated index value). Any strike prices listed by the Exchange shall be within thirty percent (30%) above or below the current value of the underlying index.</p><p>(d) Additional Series. The Exchange may open up to 10 additional series for each option class that participates in the Short Term Option Series Program when the Exchange deems it necessary to maintain an orderly market, to meet customer demand or when the current value of the underlying index moves substantially from the exercise price or prices of the series already opened. Any additional strike prices listed by the Exchange shall be within thirty percent (30%) above or below the current value of the underlying index. The Exchange may also open additional strike prices on Short Term Option Series that are more than 30% above or below the current value of the underlying index provided that demonstrated customer interest exists for such series, as expressed by institutional, corporate or individual customers or their brokers. Market makers trading for their own account shall not be considered when determining customer interest under this provision. In the event that the underlying security has moved such that there are no series that are at least 10% above or below the current price of the underlying security, the Exchange will delist any series with no open interest in both the call and the put series having a: (i) strike higher than the highest strike price with open interest in the put and/or call series for a given expiration month; and (ii) strike lower than the lowest strike price with open interest in the put and/or the call series for a given expiration month, so as to list series that are at least 10% but not more than 30% above or below the current price of the underlying security. In the event that the underlying security has moved such that there are no series that are at least 10% above or below the current price of the underlying security and all existing series have open interest, the Exchange may list additional series, in excess of the 30 allowed under this Supplementary Material .01, that are between 10% and 30% above or below the price of the underlying security. The opening of the new Short Term Option Series shall not affect the series of options of the same class previously opened. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Rule, Short Term Option Series may be added up to, and including on, the Short Term Option Expiration Date for that options series.</p><p>(e) Strike Interval. The interval between strike prices on Short Term Option Series shall be the same as the strike prices for series in that same index option class that expire in accordance with the normal monthly expiration cycle. During the month prior to expiration of an index option class that is selected for the Short Term Option Series Program pursuant to this Rule (&#8220;Short Term Option&#8221;), the strike price intervals for the related index non-Short Term Option (&#8220;Related non-Short Term Option&#8221;) shall be the same as the strike price intervals for the index Short Term Option.</p><p>.02 Quarterly Options Series Program: Notwithstanding the restriction in Options 4A, Section 12(a)(3), the Exchange may list and trade options series that expire at the close of business on the last business day of a calendar quarter (&#8220;Quarterly Options Series&#8221;). The Exchange may list Quarterly Options Series for up to five (5) currently listed options classes that are either index options or options on exchange traded funds (&#8220;ETFs&#8221;). In addition, the Exchange may also list Quarterly Options Series on any options classes that are selected by other securities exchanges that employ a similar pilot program under their respective rules.</p><p>(a) Expiration. The Exchange may list series that expire at the end of the next consecutive four (4) calendar quarters, as well as the fourth quarter of the next calendar year.</p><p>(b) The Exchange will not list a Short Term Option Series on an options class whose expiration coincides with that of a Quarterly Options Series on that same options class.</p><p>(c) Settlement. Quarterly Options Series shall be P.M. settled.</p><p>(d) Initial Series. The strike price of each Quarterly Options Series will be fixed at a price per share, with at least two, but no more than five, strike prices above and at least two, but no more than five, strike prices below the value of the underlying index at about the time that a Quarterly Options Series is opened for trading on the Exchange. The Exchange shall list strike prices for Quarterly Options Series that are reasonably related to the current index value of the underlying index to which such series relates at about the time such series of options is first opened for trading on the Exchange. The term &#8220;reasonably related to the current index value of the underlying index&#8221; means that the exercise price is within thirty percent (30%) of the current index value.</p><p>(e) Additional Series. The Exchange may open for trading additional Quarterly Options Series of the same class when the Exchange deems it necessary to maintain an orderly market, to meet customer demand or when the market price of the underlying security moves substantially from the initial exercise price or prices. The Exchange may also open for trading additional Quarterly Options Series that are more than thirty percent (30%) away from the current index value, provided that demonstrated customer interest exists for such series, as expressed by institutional, corporate, or individual customers or their brokers. Market-makers trading for their own account shall not be considered when determining customer interest under this provision. The Exchange may open additional strike prices of a Quarterly Options Series that are above the value of the underlying index provided that the total number of strike prices above the value of the underlying is no greater than five. The Exchange may open additional strike prices of a Quarterly Options Series that are below the value of the underlying index provided that the total number of strike prices below the value of the underlying index is no greater than five. The opening of any new Quarterly Options Series shall not affect the series of options of the same class previously opened.</p><p>(f) Strike Interval. The interval between strike prices on Quarterly Options Series shall be the same as the interval for strike prices for series in that same options class that expire in accordance with the normal monthly expiration cycle.</p><p>.03 Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in this Rule, the Exchange may list additional series of index options classes if such series are listed on at least one other national securities exchange in accordance with the applicable rules of such exchange for the listing of index options. For each options series listed pursuant to this Supplementary Material .03, the Exchange will submit a proposed rule change with the Securities and Exchange Commission that is effective upon filing within the meaning of Section 19(b)(3)(A) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p><p>.04 Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in this Rule and any Supplementary Material thereto, the Exchange may list additional expiration months on options classes opened for trading on the Exchange if such expiration months are opened for trading on at least one other registered national securities exchange.</p><p>.05 Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in this Rule and any Supplementary Material thereto, the Exchange may open for trading Short Term Option Series on the Short Term Option Opening Date that expire on the Short Term Option Expiration Date at strike price intervals of (i) $0.50 or greater where the strike price is less than $75, and $1 or greater where the strike price is between $75 and $150 for all index option classes that participate in the Short Term Options Series Program; or (ii) $0.50 for index option classes that trade in one dollar increments and are in the Short Term Option Series Program.</p><p>.06 In the case of the Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index, the total number of components may not decrease from the number of components in the index at the time of its initial listing.</p><p>.07 Nonstandard Expirations Pilot Program</p><p>(a) Weekly Expirations. The Exchange may open for trading Weekly Expirations on any broad-based index eligible for standard options trading to expire on any Monday, Wednesday, or Friday (other than the third Friday-of-the-month or days that coincide with an EOM expiration). Weekly Expirations shall be subject to all provisions of this Rule and treated the same as options on the same underlying index that expire on the third Friday of the expiration month; provided, however, that Weekly Expirations shall be P.M.-settled and new series in Weekly Expirations may be added up to and including on the expiration date for an expiring Weekly Expiration.</p><p>The maximum number of expirations that may be listed for each Weekly Expiration (i.e., a Monday expiration, Wednesday expiration, or Friday expiration, as applicable) in a given class is the maximum number of expirations permitted for standard index options in Options 4A, Section 12(a)(3). Weekly Expirations need not be for consecutive Monday, Wednesday, or Friday expirations as applicable; however, the expiration date of a non-consecutive expiration may not be beyond what would be considered the last expiration date if the maximum number of expirations were listed consecutively. Weekly Expirations that are initially listed in a given class may expire up to four weeks from the actual listing date. If the last trading day of a month is a Monday, Wednesday, or Friday and the Exchange lists EOMs and Weekly Expirations as applicable in a given class, the Exchange will list an EOM instead of a Weekly Expiration in the given class. Other expirations in the same class are not counted as part of the maximum number of Weekly Expirations for a broad-based index class. If the Exchange is not open for business on a respective Monday, the normally Monday expiring Weekly Expirations will expire on the following business day. If the Exchange is not open for business on a respective Wednesday or Friday, the normally Wednesday or Friday expiring Weekly Expirations will expire on the previous business day.</p><p>(b) End of Month (&#8220;EOM&#8221;) Expirations. The Exchange may open for trading EOMs on any broad-based index eligible for standard options trading to expire on last trading day of the month. EOMs shall be subject to all provisions of this Rule and treated the same as options on the same underlying index that expire on the third Friday of the expiration month; provided, however, that EOMs shall be P.M.-settled and new series in EOMs may be added up to and including on the expiration date for an expiring EOM.</p><p>The maximum number of expirations that may be listed for EOMs in a given class is the same as the maximum number of expirations permitted for standard options on the same broad-based index. EOM expirations need not be for consecutive end of month expirations; however, the expiration date of a non-consecutive expiration may not be beyond what would be considered the last expiration date if the maximum number of expirations were listed consecutively. EOMs that are first listed in a given class may expire up to four weeks from the actual listing date. Other expirations in the same class are not counted as part of the maximum numbers of EOM expirations for a broad-based index class.</p><p>(c) Duration of Nonstandard Expirations Pilot Program. The Nonstandard Expirations Pilot Program shall be through November 4, 2019.</p><p>(d) Weekly Expirations and EOM Trading Hours. Transactions in Weekly Expirations and EOMs may be effected on the Exchange between the hours of 9:30 A.M. (Eastern Time) and 4:15 P.M. (Eastern Time), except that that on the last trading day, transactions in expiring p.m.-settled broad-based index options may be effected on the Exchange between the hours of 9:30 a.m. (Eastern time) and 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time).</p><p>[Adopted June 6, 2019 (SR-ISE-2019-17); amended June 6, 2019 (SR-ISE-2019-18).]</p>","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":456655,"ParentPartSourceId":"b9e4b435-95fe-1bfb-40a6-2c6169638bd8","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":393531,"LegislationSourceId":"da4047d0-c2a7-7152-d78f-8730e8178f10","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Nasdaq ise rules","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"c1b5f8c4-474a-4691-9d47-999dd90894ec","JurisdictionName":"United States of America","IssuingBodySourceId":"64fc69f7-e62e-46d2-a6f9-1d91d3c85d51","IssuingBodyName":"Nasdaq ISE","PartVersionId":456705,"PartSourceId":"c9a250dc-6f4d-5b56-38b3-974dacbea6b3","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":14,"Content":"<p>Debit put spread positions in European-style, broad-based index options traded on the Exchange (hereinafter &#8220;debit put spreads&#8221;) may be maintained in a cash account as defined by Federal Reserve Board Regulation T Section 220.8 by a Public Customer, provided that the following procedures and criteria are met:</p><p>(a) The customer has received Exchange approval to maintain debit put spreads in a cash account carried by an Exchange Member.

A Member may Give Up a Restricted OCC Number provided the Member has written authorization as described in paragraph (b)(ii) below (&#8220;Authorized Member&#8221;).</p><p>(b) Opt In. Clearing Members may request the Exchange restrict one or more of their OCC clearing numbers (&#8220;Opt In&#8221;) as described in subparagraph (i) below. If a Clearing Member Opts In, the Exchange will require written authorization from the Clearing Member permitting a Member to Give Up a Clearing Member&apos;s Restricted OCC Number. An Opt In would remain in effect until the Clearing Member terminates the Opt In as described in subparagraph (iii) below. If a Clearing Member does not Opt In, that Clearing Member&apos;s OCC number would be subject to Give Up by any Member.</p><p>(i) Clearing Member Process to Opt In. A Clearing Member may Opt In by sending a completed &#8220;Clearing Member Restriction Form&#8221; listing all Restricted OCC Numbers and Authorized Members. A Clearing Member may elect to restrict one or more OCC clearing numbers that are registered in its name at OCC. The Clearing Member would be required to submit the Clearing Member Restriction Form to the Exchange&apos;s Membership Department as described on the form. Once submitted, the Exchange requires ninety days before a Restricted OCC Number is effective within the System.</p><p>(ii) Member Give Up Process for Restricted OCC Numbers. A Member desiring to Give Up a Restricted OCC Number must become an Authorized Member. The Clearing Member will be required to authorize a Member as described in subparagraph (i) or (iii), unless the Restricted OCC Number is already subject to a Letter of Guarantee that the Member is a party to, as set forth in paragraph (d) below.</p><p>(iii) Amendments to Authorized Members or Restricted OCC Numbers. A Clearing Member may amend its Authorized Members or Restricted OCC Numbers by submitting a new Clearing Member Restriction Form to the Exchange&apos;s Membership Department indicating the amendment as described on the form. Once a Restricted OCC Number is effective within the System pursuant to paragraph (i) above, the Exchange may permit the Clearing Member to authorize, or remove authorization for, a Member to Give Up the Restricted OCC Number intra-day only in unusual circumstances, and on the next business day in all regular circumstances. The Exchange will promptly notify Members if they are no longer authorized to Give Up a Clearing Member&apos;s Restricted OCC Number. If a Clearing Member removes a Restricted OCC Number, any Member may Give Up that OCC clearing number once the removal has become effective on or before the next business day.</p><p>(c) System.

Members may not accept exercise instructions for customer or non-customer accounts after 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>(d) Submission of Contrary Exercise Advices. A Contrary Exercise Advice is a communication either:</p><p>(A) to not exercise an option that would be automatically exercised under the Clearing Corporation&apos;s Ex-by-Ex procedure, or</p><p>(B) to exercise an option that would not be automatically exercised under the Clearing Corporation&apos;s Ex-by-Ex procedure.</p><p>(i) A Contrary Exercise Advice may be submitted to the Exchange by a Member by using the Exchange&apos;s Contrary Exercise Advice Form, the Clearing Corporation&apos;s ENCORE system, a Contrary Exercise Advice form of any other national securities exchange of which the firm is a Member and where the option is listed, or such other method as the Exchange may prescribe.

Members have until 7:30 Eastern Time to submit a Contrary Exercise Advice to the Exchange.</p><p>(iii) Deadline for CEA Submission for Non-Customer Accounts. Members have until 7:30 Eastern Time to submit a Contrary Exercise Advice to the Exchange if such Member employs an electronic submission procedure with time stamp for the submission of exercise instructions by option holders. Members are required to manually submit a Contrary Exercise Advice by 5:30 p.m. for non-customer accounts if such Members do not employ an electronic submission procedure with time stamp for the submission of exercise instructions by option holders.</p><p>(e) If the Clearing Corporation has waived the Ex-by-Ex procedure for an options class, Members must either:</p><p>(1) submit to the Exchange, a Contrary Exercise Advice, in a manner specified by the Exchange, within the time limits specified in paragraph (d) above if the holder intends to exercise the option; or</p><p>(2) take no action and allow the option to expire without being exercised.</p><p>(3) In cases where the Ex-by-Ex procedure has been waived, the Rules of the Clearing Corporation require that Members wishing to exercise such options must submit an affirmative Exercise Notice to the Clearing Corporation, whether or not a Contrary Exercise Advice has been filed with the Exchange.</p><p>(f) A Member that has accepted the responsibility to indicate final exercise decisions on behalf of another Member or non-Member broker-dealer shall take the necessary steps to ensure that such decisions are properly indicated to the Exchange. Such Member may establish a processing cut-off time prior to the Exchange&apos;s exercise cut-off time at which it will no longer accept final exercise decisions in expiring options from option holders for whom it indicates final exercise decisions. Each Member that indicates final exercise decisions through another broker-dealer is responsible for ensuring that final exercise decisions for all of its proprietary (including Market Maker) and public customer account positions are indicated in a timely manner to such broker-dealer.</p><p>(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Members may make final exercise decisions after the exercise cut-off time but prior to expiration without having submitted a Contrary Exercise Advice in the circumstances listed below. A memorandum setting forth the circumstance giving rise to instructions after the exercise cutoff time shall be maintained by the Member and a copy thereof shall be filed with the Exchange no later than 12:00 noon Eastern Time on the first business day following the respective expiration. An exercise decision after the exercise cut-off time may be made:</p><p>(1) in order to remedy mistakes or errors made in good faith; or</p><p>(2) where exceptional circumstances have restricted an option holder&apos;s ability to inform a Member of a decision regarding exercise, or a Member&apos;s ability to receive an option holder&apos;s decision by the cut-off time. The burden of establishing any of the above exceptions rests solely on the Member seeking to rely on such exceptions.</p><p>(h) In the event the Exchange provides advance notice on or before 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time on the business day immediately prior to the business day of expiration, or, in the case of an option contract expiring on a day that is not a business day, the business day immediately prior to the last business day before the expiration date, indicating that a modified time for the close of trading in equity options on such business day of expiration, or, in the case of an option contract expiring on a day that is not a business day, such last business day before expiration will occur, then the deadline to make a final decision to exercise or not exercise an expiring option shall be 1 hour 30 minutes following the time announced for the close of trading on that day instead of the 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time deadline found in Options 6B, Section 1(c). However, Members have until 7:30 Eastern Time to deliver a Contrary Exercise Advice or Advice Cancel to the Exchange for customer accounts and non-customer accounts where such Member employs an electronic submission procedure with time stamp for the submission of exercise instructions. For non-customer accounts, Members that do not employ an electronic procedure with time stamp for the submission of exercise instructions are required to deliver a Contrary Exercise Advice or Advice Cancel within 1 hour and 30 minutes following the time announced for the close of trading on that day instead of the 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time deadline found in Options 6B, Section 1(d).</p><p>(i) Modification of cut-off time.</p><p>(1) The Exchange may establish extended cut-off times for decision to exercise or not exercise an expiring option and for the submission of Contrary Exercise Advices on a case-by-case basis due to unusual circumstances.

Each such Member on its own behalf or on behalf of a designated aggregation unit pursuant to Options 9, Section 14 (a)(7)(D) shall also report, in accordance with Option 9, Section 16, for each such account that holds an equity option position subject to this exemption in excess of the levels specified in this Options 9, Section 14, the net delta and the options contract equivalent of the net delta of such position.</p><p>(G) Records. Each Member relying on this exemption shall: (i) retain, and undertake reasonable efforts to ensure that any non-Member affiliate of the Member relying on this exemption retains, a list of the options, securities and other instruments underlying each option position net delta calculation reported to the Exchange hereunder, and (ii) produce such information to the Exchange upon request.</p><p>(8) A listed option position hedged on a one-for-one basis with an over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) option position on the same underlying security.

The positions must generally be within ten percent (10%) of the limits contained in Options 9, Section 13 for equity options and twenty percent (20%) of those limits for broad-based index options.</p><p>(4) If an exemption is granted, it will be effective at the time the decision is communicated, and retroactive exemptions will not be granted.</p><p>(5) The size and length of an exemption will be determined on a case by case basis; however, an exemption usually will be granted until the nearest expiration. The exemption may specify the extent to which the resulting position may be carried in options in one or more expiration cycles.</p><p>(6) Procedures for Market Makers nearing the limits due to general market conditions:</p><p>(i) A request for an exemption from the established position and exercise limits must be in writing and must state the specific reasons why an exemption should be granted.</p><p>(ii) The request should be submitted to the Exchange no later than 1:00 p.m. for same-day review.</p><p>(iii) Review of the request will be conducted informally, i.e., the Exchange may receive information in such manner as is most effective, in its discretion, to ascertain whether an exemption is necessary to maintain depth and liquidity in the market.</p><p>(iv) The Exchange will communicate the exemption decision to the requesting Market Maker and his or its Clearing Member as soon as possible, generally on the day following review.</p><p>(7) Requests for instant exemptions may be made for extraordinary situations, such as when there is an order imbalance or a Market Maker is near the limits intraday. Following immediate review of the situation, the Exchange will decide whether an exemption is warranted.</p><p>(c) Firm Facilitation Exemption. To the extent that the following procedures and criteria are satisfied, a Member may receive and maintain for its proprietary account an exemption (&#8220;facilitation exemption&#8221;) from the applicable standard position limit in non-multiply-listed options traded on the Exchange for the purpose of facilitating, pursuant to the provisions of Options 3, Section 11(d), (i) orders for its own Public Customer (one that will have the resulting position carried with the firm) or (ii) orders received from or on behalf of a Public Customer for execution only against the Member firm&apos;s proprietary account.</p><p>(1) The Member must receive approval from the Exchange prior to executing facilitating trades.</p><p>(2) The facilitation exemption shall be granted to the Member owning or controlling the account in which the exempt options positions are held. For purposes of this paragraph (c), control shall be determined in accordance with the provision of Options 9, Section 13(f).</p><p>(3) Exchange approval may be given on the basis of verbal representations, in which event the Member shall, within a period of time to be designated by the Exchange, furnish the appropriate forms and documentation substantiating the basis for the exemption. The approval for the facilitation exemption will specify the maximum number of contracts that may be exempt under this paragraph (c).

Therefore, this type of strategy may not be suitable for all customers approved for options transactions.</p><p>1. The potential loss of uncovered call writing is unlimited. The writer of an uncovered call is in an extremely risky position, and may incur large losses if the value of the underlying instrument increases above the exercise price.</p><p>2. As with writing uncovered calls, the risk of writing uncovered put options is substantial. The writer of an uncovered put option bears a risk of loss if the value of the underlying instrument declines below the exercise price. Such loss could be substantial if there is a significant decline in the value of the underlying instrument.</p><p>3. Uncovered options writing is thus suitable only for the knowledgeable investor who understands the risks, has the financial capacity and willingness to incur potentially substantial losses, and has sufficient liquid assets to meet applicable margin requirements. In this regard, if the value of the underlying instrument moves against an uncovered writer&apos;s options position, the investor&apos;s broker may request significant additional margin payments. If an investor does not make such margin payments, the broker may liquidate stock or options positions in the investor&apos;s account with little or no prior notice in accordance with the investor&apos;s margin agreement.</p><p>4. For combination writing, where the investor writes both a put and a call on the same underlying instrument, the potential risk is unlimited.</p><p>5. If a secondary market in options were to become unavailable, investors could not engage in closing transactions, and an options writer would remain obligated until expiration or assignment.</p><p>6. The writer of an American-style option is subject to being assigned an exercise at any time after he has written the option until the option expires. By contrast, the writer of a European-style option is subject to exercise assignment only during the exercise period.</p><p>NOTE: It is expected that you will read the booklet entitled CHARACTERISTICS AND RISKS OF STANDARDIZED OPTIONS available from your broker.
