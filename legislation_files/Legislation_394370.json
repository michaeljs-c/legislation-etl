Orders may be entered, modified and cancelled during an auction call, (along with any extensions and random periods) but no automated execution occurs. Throughout the entire period London Stock Exchange disseminates the most up to date indicative auction price and uncrossing volume. This will be updated whenever orders are added, deleted, modified and result in a new auction price / volume.</p><p>7.2.1 Intra-day auction (Scheduled Level 1 Only)</p><p>The Intra-day auction is a specialised version of the Periodic auction call trading session, called the Scheduled Level 1 Only Auction. Whilst all other auctions provide full level 2 depth throughout, this is not the case for Scheduled Level 1 Only auction. At the transition to this auction call phase an order book clear message is generated, removing the breakdown of the depth of the orders on the book (Level 2 price and quantity information). Whilst they can not be individually seen, any orders valid for an auction phase continue to remain active.</p><p>Throughout Scheduled Level 1 Only auction call phase and any subsequent price monitoring or market orders extensions, only Level 1 data (including indicative uncrossing price and trade size) will be published. Following the completion of the uncrossing and the parking or expiry of any un-executed orders with an auction time in force, the full level 2 depth of the book is re-disseminated and the regular trading session resumes.</p><p>The Scheduled Level 1 Only auction offers participants the opportunity to execute larger orders during a specifically created liquidity point in the middle of the trading day, within the lit price-forming environment. The suppression of Level 2 information encourages the submission of larger orders, free from the concern that should they not get executed there would be potential information leakage into the rest of the day&#8217;s regular trading session.</p><p>Participants wishing to submit orders earlier in the trading day, without having to wait until the call actually starts, can use the Time in Force GFS anytime after the completion of that day&#8217;s opening auction. These orders will then be injected at the start of the Scheduled Level 1 Only auction call.

The order book will continue to update when orders are deleted.</p><p>11.4.3 Market / Partition Suspension</p><p>If London Stock Exchange determines the outage is likely to be very severe or long-lasting and particularly if it wishes to suspend all order entry and deletion, then a Suspension/System Halt will be invoked at either Market or Partition level.
