This applies whether the order is submitted by the member firm itself or has been automatically routed from a third party (whether another member firm or not).</p><p>Certain trading practices that exploit the commitment given by firms that act as RSPs are considered to be detrimental to the fairness and integrity of the Exchange&#8217;s markets and should be discouraged. For example, an order is entered onto the order book with the intention of creating a new best price, away from generally accepted trading levels, for the principle purpose of executing a larger order against an RSP by virtue of the RSP&apos;s previous commitment to deal on the basis of the current best order book price.</p><p>In any instance where a firm trades either as principal or as agent on behalf of an employee of the firm in a manner and with an intention similar to that described above, the Exchange will conduct a full investigation into the circumstances of the activity and, if considered appropriate, will initiate disciplinary action.</p><p>Where a firm deals in a manner similar to that described above (regarding the commitment given by firms that act as RSPs) on behalf of a customer, the firm will not be in breach of the Exchange&#8217;s rules per se. However, although the Exchange&#8217;s rules do not specifically require a firm to establish the motives behind a customer&#8217;s trade, if the Exchange becomes aware that a firm is knowingly engaging in such a trading strategy on behalf of a customer, the Exchange will conduct an investigation and consider whether disciplinary action or a referral to another regulatory body is appropriate.</p><p>Entry and deletion of orders</p><p>All orders entered on to the order book are firm. While the Exchange understands that trading decisions of member firms may change, member firms should not enter orders into the auction or during regular trading with the intention of deleting or otherwise amending them before execution. This can give a potentially misleading impression of the level of liquidity in the market or the likely auction uncrossing price and volume to other participants. Such activity may constitute a breach of rule 1400.</p><p>Short selling</p><p>Member firms are required to have at all times adequate systems and controls to ensure that their business is being conducted and settled in accordance with the Exchange&#8217;s rules. These systems should enable member firms to monitor trading positions (long and short), identify stock shortages, settlement delays or backlogs, particularly where these may be attributable to running a substantial short position in a particular security. Member firms are also obliged under rule 1400 not to do any act or engage in any course of conduct which is likely to damage the fairness or integrity of the Exchange&#8217;s markets, or which might create a false or misleading impression as to the markets or price of a security. Member firms must ensure that when they undertake short selling on a substantial scale, either on their own account or on behalf of customers, they have a clear strategy for ensuring the settlement of their short positions. If member firms believe at any point that they will be unable to fulfil their settlement obligations they should not continue to pursue their short selling strategy.</p><p>Short selling on a substantial scale can lead to significant settlement problems, which in turn can result in the Exchange having to issue a market status message warning the market of settlement problems. Where the Exchange issues such a message firms should consider very carefully whether further short selling will exacerbate the situation, in which case member firms should not continue to short sell (unless stock is available to cover any new positions).

Accordingly, it is essential that a member firm contact the Exchange as soon as possible when it experiences a system failure, especially if it wishes to have its orders deleted from the book.</p><p>Once the systems problem is rectified, the member firm should contact the Market Supervision department to notify them of this fact. The member firm can recommence order input to the trading system as soon as the systems problem is rectified.</p><p>If a member firm wishes to reverse an automatically executed trade in accordance with rule 2110 while it is experiencing a systems problem, it should seek guidance from the Market Supervision department on (+44 (0)20 7797 3666, (STX 33666) - option 2, to determine whether a contra submission should be made immediately or after the system problem is resolved.</p><p>Order and quote deletion and restriction of submission:</p><p>Member firms have primary responsibility for deleting their own orders and restricting the submission of their orders. Where this is not possible, the Exchange will aim to provide a back-up service to delete orders and/or to restrict the member firm&#8217;s access to submit orders.</p><p>The Exchange will maintain a list of employees in the Member Portal authorised by each member firm to request the deletion of orders and quotes or to restrict access. A person authorised by a member firm must be&quot;a director, partner or principal or person employed in or about the firm&apos;s business as a member firm, whether under a contract of service or for services (including a training contract) and any person seconded to work in or about that business&quot;.</p><p>If a member firm requests the Exchange to delete its orders or quotes and/or to restrict their access, the Exchange will only action this request if it comes from a person named on the member firm&#8217;s authorised person list. The Exchange will refuse to provide details of the names on a member firm&#8217;s authorised list to anyone not themselves on the list and a request received from someone not on the authorised list will be declined. In this event the Exchange will contact the member firm&#8217;s compliance department for clarification in respect of the request.</p><p>Member firms that choose to segregate their business by multiple Trader Groups will need to provide a list of individuals authorised to delete orders on behalf of each Trader Group. Member firms are advised to ensure that the list is broad enough to provide sufficient coverage in cases of staff absence. For example, it may be more practical to have a number of nominated people in compliance who are authorised to request deletions for all Trader Groups.</p><p>Member firms should register authorised employees or changes in their status with the Exchange using the Member Portal.</p><p>Recognition of new authorised employees will be effective on the business day after the notification is received by the Exchange.</p><p>When contacting the Exchange to request the deletion of an order or quote, the authorised person must provide the following information:</p><p>&#8226; the name of the member firm;</p><p>&#8226; the member firm&#8217;s member ID;</p><p>&#8226; the member firm&#8217;s trader group; or</p><p>&#8226; the member firm&#8217;s Comp ID;</p><p>&#8226; the identity of the caller and a contact number; and</p><p>&#8226; the reason for the request (e.g. system problems, building evacuation).</p><p>For single order deletions (up to a maximum of five), the member firm must also provide the Order ID. If this is not available, the member firm should provide:</p><p>&#8226; the name of the security;</p><p>&#8226; whether it is a buy or a sell;</p><p>&#8226; the price and size; and</p><p>&#8226; the time the order was entered.</p><p>If a member firm requests the deletion of more than one order in a single security, each of the orders will count towards the maximum allowed number of five order deletions. The Market Supervision department will normally delete all orders within a particular segment. However, upon application, the Market Supervision department will consider the deletion of individual orders providing the total of individual orders does not exceed five.</p><p>For mass order deletions, the member firm must provide the following information:</p><p>&#8226; whether it wants all orders and/or quotes deleted; and</p><p>&#8226; the specific segments to which the deletions should apply.</p><p>Member firms should be aware that all parked orders will be deleted during a mass order deletion performed by the Exchange.</p><p>The Market Supervision department will attempt to delete orders, quotes and/or restrict access on a best endeavours basis and at its absolute discretion, as soon as possible after receipt of a valid request to do so.</p><p>However, if an order is executed during the period between a member firm requesting deletion of its orders and the Market Supervision department effecting the deletions or access restriction the member firm will be obliged to honour the trade.</p><p>Trade reporting:</p><p>Where a member firm has a system problem that prevents it from submitting a trade report (where it has the responsibility to do so), the member firm must immediately upon execution of the trade having exhausted all means of its connectivity to the Exchange, inform the Market Supervision department on (+44 (0)20 7797 3666, (STX 33666).</p><p>The Exchange will determine what trade details it requires until such time as the problem is resolved. This will normally be any trade in a size that is in excess of six times the Exchange market size for the security (or the equivalent average daily turnover) or a consideration in excess of &#163;1,000,000. The same procedure will apply to the correction of a trade report during a system problem. Such trades must not then be re-reported by the member firm once the system problem has been resolved.</p><p>If any trades are re-reported, they should be cancelled as soon as the member firm becomes aware of the error. If a member firm is unable to effect a cancellation it should contact the Exchange immediately.</p><p>If the Exchange is not informed of a member firm&apos;s trade reporting difficulties, it will treat resultant late trade reports as breaches of rule 3020.</p><p>Market maker systems:</p><p>In the event of a market maker system problem, including a problem arising from an act or omission beyond the market maker&#8217;s control, the market maker should notify the Exchange that it is unable to update its quotes on the trading system. If system problems persist on subsequent business days, the market maker is required to notify the Market Supervision department on (+44 (0)20 7797 3666, (STX 33666) prior to the start of the mandatory period of each subsequent day.</p><p>If a market maker cannot update or delete its own quotes, it may ask the Exchange to close its prices in a sector or segment until the fault has been repaired. Where a reported fault affects a dealer terminal only, that market maker in a quote-driven security is expected to continue to quote firm prices over the telephone.</p><p>If a market maker in a quote-driven security has problems with any telephone lines associated with its dealing desk, the market maker should notify the Exchange as soon as possible.</p><p>The market maker should re-enter its quotes as soon as it is able to do so, notifying the Exchange beforehand. In all cases a market maker shall ensure that the Market Supervision department is kept appropriately informed.</p><p>Amended N09/17 &#8211; effective 3 January 2018)</p>","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":1180107,"ParentPartSourceId":"dd417b86-d5c9-48d3-9a63-a1a86151ecb1","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":21794,"LegislationSourceId":"8a598c40-d3f3-11e8-8efb-484d7ee15899","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Rules of the london stock exchange","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"6bd90564-8335-4f44-a449-b8e82eaafa5b","JurisdictionName":"United Kingdom","IssuingBodySourceId":"475a29ea-3918-4bb9-9014-82082606a68b","IssuingBodyName":"London Stock Exchange","PartVersionId":1180078,"PartSourceId":"ef3d3195-1bbf-46f8-8985-9e301d9e868b","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":1,"Content":"<table><tr><td><p>G</p></td><td><p>1510</p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>The Exchange may prohibit any trade or class of trades from being dealt on Exchange.</p></td></tr></table><p>Guidance to Rule:</p><p>Examples of a regulatory suspension are:</p><p>&#8226; a suspension imposed by the competent authority or market operator of the relevant market; or</p><p>&#8226; a suspension for orderly market reasons imposed by the Exchange.</p><p>When a security is suspended by the Exchange, the Exchange will delete any orders and close any quotations present in the trading system in the suspended security.</p><p>The Exchange may exercise its power to suspend or remove from trading a MiFID transparent security which no longer complies with the rules unless such a step would be likely to cause significant damage to the interests of investors or the orderly functioning of the financial markets.</p><p>(Amended N09/17 &#8211; effective 3 January 2018)</p><table><tr><td><p></p></td><td><p>1511</p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>A member firm shall not effect a trade in securities in respect of which trades are prohibited under these rules or which are the subject of a notice or order suspending trading on Exchange other than in accordance with rule 1513.</p></td></tr></table><table><tr><td><p>G</p></td><td><p>1512</p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>Where a member firm learns of a regulatory suspension of a security on a relevant market where that security, or a security underlying that security is also on the trading system, it should promptly notify the Exchange and any other member firms which approach it to deal in the affected security on the trading system.</p></td></tr></table><p>Guidance to Rule:</p><p>Where overseas securities traded on the Exchange are not listed by the UKLA, the treatment of suspensions must be co-ordinated with the actions of other exchanges and the needs of the market.</p><p>(Amended N09/17 &#8211; effective 3 January 2018)</p><table><tr><td><p>G</p></td><td><p>1513</p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>A member firm may apply to the Exchange for permission to effect trades in a security in which trading is suspended by the Exchange.

or &#8220;US&#8221;). The following guidance is provided by way of assistance only and a member firm should seek independent legal advice as to the applicability of these laws. Member firms are also directed to the disclosure relating to Regulation S, Category 3 restrictions under the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;US Securities Act&#8221;) or other restrictions under US securities laws in the relevant prospectus.</p><p>For the purposes of the rules, the term Reg S traded security refers to any security identified to the Exchange as such by or on behalf of the issuer of the security. When a security has been so identified, the Exchange will require that the letters &#8216;REG S&#8217; be added to the end of its name as shown in the trading system. The &#8216;REG S&#8217; identifier signifies that the relevant securities are subject to Regulation S, Category 3 restrictions under the US Securities Act and are deemed to include the restrictive legend required by Rule 903(b)(3)(iii)(B)(3) under the US Securities Act. The Exchange will place the security in a separate sector of the trading system containing other Reg S traded securities only for the duration of the period of restriction. Upon notification by the issuer to the Exchange that restrictions no longer apply, the &#8216;REG S&#8217; marker will be removed from the security&#8217;s name and it will be placed in an appropriate sector. This information will be disseminated via Datasync, the Exchange&#8217;s Reference Data Service. A list of Reg S traded securities is available on the Exchange&#8217;s website, which will specify the standard place of settlement for the security.</p><p>Generally, Reg S traded securities have been issued by companies incorporated in the United States and initially offered and sold without being registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) under the US Securities Act and are subject to a one-year distribution compliance period under Regulation S. (Note, there are also companies incorporated outside the United States that may fall within the definition of &#8220;domestic issuer&#8221; for Regulation S purposes.) As such, Reg S traded securities are considered &#8220;restricted&#8221; securities, and they must be traded only in accordance with Regulation S, pursuant to registration under the US Securities Act or pursuant to an available exemption from the registration requirements of the US Securities Act.</p><p>Among other requirements, Regulation S provides that securities issued pursuant thereto may not be purchased by, or on behalf of, &#8220;US persons&#8221; (as defined in Rule 902(k) of Regulation S) in reliance on Rule 904 under Regulation S during the one-year distribution compliance period commencing upon the closing of the initial public offering. Generally, therefore, a security will be identified as a Reg S traded security until the first anniversary of its admission to trading. However, it is the responsibility of the issuer to determine when the restrictions applicable to trading of its Reg S traded security may be removed, and, accordingly, at the issuer&#8217;s discretion and by agreement with the Exchange, a security may be treated as a Reg S traded security for a period longer than one year.</p><p>Prior to purchasing a Reg S traded security, a member firm must take reasonable steps to ascertain whether its customer is resident in the United States or may otherwise be considered to be a US person or is acting for the account or benefit of a US person. A member firm must design, implement and maintain measures to assure compliance with the rule, such as, by way of example, obtaining or reconfirming within the last 12 months a certification from its customer that he, she or it is not a US person within the meaning of the above-mentioned Rule 902(k) and that such customer understands and accepts the restrictions and limitations imposed by Regulation S on purchasers of such securities. Reg S traded securities may not be purchased on behalf of a US person, unless the Reg S traded security is also identified as being Rule 144A eligible. A Reg S traded security also identified as being 144A eligible may be purchased by, or on behalf of, a US person who is also a qualified institutional buyer (&#8220;QIB&#8221;) as defined in Rule 144A and who is purchasing in reliance on Rule 144A.</p><p>Regulation S also requires that offers to sell Reg S traded securities not be made to persons in the United States; that, at the time a buy order is originated, the seller and any person acting on its behalf reasonably believe that the buyer is outside the United States; and that neither the seller nor any person acting on its behalf knows that the trade has been pre-arranged with a buyer in the United States. In addition, Regulation S requires that no &#8220;directed selling efforts&#8221; (as defined in Rule 902(c) of Regulation S) are made in the United States by the seller, an affiliate or any person acting on their behalf, and that if the seller is a dealer or a person receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration in respect of the securities offered or sold, neither the seller nor any person acting on its behalf knows that the offeree or buyer is a US person.</p><p>Guidance associated with Rule 5000 provides that where an agency broker deals with a market principal on behalf of a customer, the market principal and the Exchange rely on the agency broker to ensure the performance of its customer. If the customer fails to deliver securities or cash, then the agency broker is responsible for any shortfall. This includes trades in Reg S traded securities which are rejected for settlement because the purchaser of the securities is identified as a US person.</p><p>(Amended N17/15 &#8211; effective 1 September 2015)</p>","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":1180107,"ParentPartSourceId":"dd417b86-d5c9-48d3-9a63-a1a86151ecb1","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":21794,"LegislationSourceId":"8a598c40-d3f3-11e8-8efb-484d7ee15899","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Rules of the london stock exchange","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"6bd90564-8335-4f44-a449-b8e82eaafa5b","JurisdictionName":"United Kingdom","IssuingBodySourceId":"475a29ea-3918-4bb9-9014-82082606a68b","IssuingBodyName":"London Stock Exchange","PartVersionId":1180037,"PartSourceId":"beb9e815-3eaa-47e1-8ad2-df854204e2cd","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":3,"Content":"","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":1180143,"ParentPartSourceId":"c3e179c2-0196-433c-88de-34ba9e0f8d63","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":21794,"LegislationSourceId":"8a598c40-d3f3-11e8-8efb-484d7ee15899","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Rules of the london stock exchange","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"6bd90564-8335-4f44-a449-b8e82eaafa5b","JurisdictionName":"United Kingdom","IssuingBodySourceId":"475a29ea-3918-4bb9-9014-82082606a68b","IssuingBodyName":"London Stock Exchange","PartVersionId":1180068,"PartSourceId":"4f528e25-ab9c-4b7d-805b-e3a206f81050","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":0,"Content":"","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":1180037,"ParentPartSourceId":"beb9e815-3eaa-47e1-8ad2-df854204e2cd","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":21794,"LegislationSourceId":"8a598c40-d3f3-11e8-8efb-484d7ee15899","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Rules of the london stock exchange","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"6bd90564-8335-4f44-a449-b8e82eaafa5b","JurisdictionName":"United Kingdom","IssuingBodySourceId":"475a29ea-3918-4bb9-9014-82082606a68b","IssuingBodyName":"London Stock Exchange","PartVersionId":1180134,"PartSourceId":"3e8a1085-bd54-40b7-9837-3209c08835e4","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":0,"Content":"<table><tr><td><p></p></td><td><p>2000</p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>A trade is on Exchange if it is effected automatically on an Exchange order book.</p></td></tr></table><p>Guidance to Rule:</p><p>A trade can also be considered to be on Exchange if conducted away from an order book as detailed in rule 3000.</p><p>For the purpose of this rule, a trade includes a central counterparty contract.</p>","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":1180068,"ParentPartSourceId":"4f528e25-ab9c-4b7d-805b-e3a206f81050","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":21794,"LegislationSourceId":"8a598c40-d3f3-11e8-8efb-484d7ee15899","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Rules of the london stock exchange","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"6bd90564-8335-4f44-a449-b8e82eaafa5b","JurisdictionName":"United Kingdom","IssuingBodySourceId":"475a29ea-3918-4bb9-9014-82082606a68b","IssuingBodyName":"London Stock Exchange","PartVersionId":1180131,"PartSourceId":"a3f79853-aca7-4493-91ec-92b310a58265","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":1,"Content":"","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":1180037,"ParentPartSourceId":"beb9e815-3eaa-47e1-8ad2-df854204e2cd","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":21794,"LegislationSourceId":"8a598c40-d3f3-11e8-8efb-484d7ee15899","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Rules of the london stock exchange","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"6bd90564-8335-4f44-a449-b8e82eaafa5b","JurisdictionName":"United Kingdom","IssuingBodySourceId":"475a29ea-3918-4bb9-9014-82082606a68b","IssuingBodyName":"London Stock Exchange","PartVersionId":1180104,"PartSourceId":"21d493a4-6beb-4ba3-95eb-8661d64224a7","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":0,"Content":"<table><tr><td><p>G</p></td><td><p>2100</p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>Each order or quote submitted to the trading system shall be:</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2100.1</p></td><td><p>firm;</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2100.2</p></td><td><p>subject only to the terms relating to benefit entitlements prevailing at the time of execution; and</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2100.3</p></td><td><p>orders only, should contain all information as set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/580.</p></td></tr></table><p>Guidance to Rule 2100.3:</p><p>This information will include details about the financial instrument and the order, details about the client of the transmitting firm and, whenever relevant, an identifier for the person or computer algorithm, that is responsible for the investment decision in relation to the order.

If an order has been submitted by or automatically routed from a third party (whether another member firm or not), then the member firm should consider how it is going to control the order flow.</p><p>Erroneous orders and quotes</p><p>An erroneous order or quote is an order or quote entered mistakenly where there was no intention to trade in the security or an order or quote where the terms entered, mistakenly, did not represent the intended transaction. For the avoidance of doubt the terms of an order or quote include but are not limited to price, size, buy and sell (direction of trade).</p><p>In determining whether an order or quote is erroneous, the Exchange will ask the member firm for details of the background to the order or quote. Below is a non-exhaustive list of scenarios where the Exchange may query an order or a quote with a member firm:</p><p>&#8226; orders or quotes that exceed the Exchange&#8217;s price monitoring thresholds;</p><p>&#8226; an aggressively priced limit order that executes against a significant number of orders on one side of the order book, which could take place, for example, if price and size have been entered in the wrong fields;</p><p>&#8226; an order that is divided into sizes either not intended by the member firm or which are so small or so large as to be inappropriate; or</p><p>&#8226; a very high priced buy order or a very low priced sell order entered into the auction period when it might be more appropriate to use a market order to guarantee execution.</p><p>Member firms should aim to prevent the entry of erroneous orders and quotes to the trading system and should ensure that their systems are designed to identify and prevent the entry of such orders and quotes. In determining whether a member firm&#8217;s systems are adequate in this regard, member firms should use controls and system alerts, which may be based on some or all of the following:</p><p>&#8226; the last order book traded price (from the previous day if appropriate);</p><p>&#8226; the current spread in the market;</p><p>&#8226; trader, security-specific or firm-wide size and price limits;</p><p>&#8226; the likely movement in the price of the security if the order or quote is submitted;</p><p>&#8226; a minimum and maximum financial consideration per order or quote; and</p><p>&#8226; controls on limit orders and market orders submitted during an auction. When entering limit and market orders in auctions member firms must have sufficient systems and controls in place so that the type of order they submit does not have an inappropriate affect on the uncrossing price of the security in question. For instance, a member firm may wish to submit a market order to an auction to maximise its probability of execution but should have regard to the possible impact of a large market order on the auction uncrossing price.</p><p>The above list is not exhaustive and member firms are likely to wish to develop their own bespoke controls and system alerts to prevent the entry of orders and quotes which, because of their price, size and/or nature, could impact on the smooth running of the market.</p><p>The parameters for any such alerts should be determined by each member firm, with reference to the nature of its business. Parameters should be set at levels such that, if no alert is generated in relation to any particular order, then the member firm should be satisfied with the execution price(s) achieved.</p><p>Member firms&#8217; procedures and controls should be designed to ensure that orders and quotes are entered correctly and that any alerts generated are responded to appropriately.</p><p>Member firms should be aware that in deciding what action to take against a member firm for the submission of any apparently erroneous order or quotes, the Exchange will consider both the potential and the actual market impact. It will also have regard to the relative frequency with which the member firm submits such orders or quotes.</p><p>(Amended N09/17 &#8211; effective 3 January 2018)</p><table><tr><td><p>GT</p></td><td><p>2102</p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>A member firm should enter a trading capacity, as described in the Guide to the trading system, when submitting orders to the trading system.</p></td></tr></table><p>(Amended N09/17 &#8211; effective 3 January 2017)</p><table><tr><td><p>G</p></td><td><p>2103</p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>The Exchange reserves the right to restrict or segregate a member firm&#8217;s access to and use of the trading system as it sees fit.</p></td></tr></table><p>Guidance to Rule:</p><p>The Exchange may decide to segregate a member firm&#8217;s access to and use of the trading system in order to protect market orderliness or for other regulatory reasons.</p><p>Whilst the Exchange does not mandate how a member firm should segregate its order book business at trader group level, the Exchange reserves the right to do this as it sees fit.

As a result, the Exchange expects member firms to:</p><p>&#8226; submit a contra request against the relevant trade on the trading system; and</p><p>&#8226; request the counterparty&#8217;s consent to the contra.</p><p>Should the contra request be turned down the Exchange may then consider cancelling the trade.</p><p>Criteria for the consideration of an Exchange enforced cancellation</p><p>When considering a member firm&#8217;s request for an Exchange enforced cancellation, the Exchange will generally have regard to the following non-exhaustive list of considerations:</p><p>&#8226; automated execution &#8211; the Exchange will only consider requests relating to automated executions on the trading system;</p><p>&#8226; time elapsed since the trade(s) &#8211; any requests from member firms to cancel trades should be made to the Market Supervision department as soon as possible and in any event within 30 minutes of the trade time. Requests from member firms to cancel the uncrossing of closing auctions which conclude after 16.30 hours must be made to the Market Supervision department no later than 17.00 hours.</p><p>&#8226; erroneous nature of the trade - any trades to be cancelled must be manifestly erroneous in the judgement of the Exchange.</p><p>&#8226; market impact - the Exchange may take into account other factors including, but not limited to, the potential market disorder that would be caused if the trade(s) were upheld or the potential adverse market impact if the trade(s) were cancelled.</p><p>Further, specific additional criteria apply respectively to automated executions in each of the tradable instruments available on the trading system. These are set out below.</p><p>Additional criteria for automated executions in equity securities</p><p>In considering a member firm&#8217;s request for an Exchange enforced cancellation in equity securities the Market Supervision department will also consider:</p><p>&#8226; the potential loss to the member firm involved. The potential loss, based on an Exchange reference price, to the member firm requesting the Exchange enforced cancellation should be significant. The Market Supervision department will only consider an Exchange enforced cancellation where the amount of loss is &#163;100,000 or more in relation to automated trades conducted in a single stock on the trading system and &#163;200,000 or more in relation to automated trades conducted in more than one stock on the trading system; and</p><p>&#8226; whether any information requested by the Market Supervision department is complete, accurate and provided promptly. The Market Supervision department will determine what information it requires from member firms on a case by case basis.</p><p>Additional criteria for automated executions in exchange traded funds and exchange traded products</p><p>In considering a member firm&#8217;s request for an Exchange enforced cancellation in exchange traded funds and exchange traded products the Market Supervision department will also consider:</p><p>&#8226; the potential loss to the member firm involved. The potential loss, based on an Exchange reference price, to the member firm requesting the Exchange enforced cancellation should be significant. The Market Supervision department will only consider an Exchange enforced cancellation where the amount of loss is &#163;50,000 or more in relation to automated trades conducted in a single stock on the trading system and &#163;100,000 or more in relation to automated trades conducted in more than one stock on the trading system; and</p><p>&#8226; whether any information requested by the Market Supervision department is complete, accurate and provided promptly.

Member firms are reminded that requests for Exchange enforced cancellations cannot be accepted by the Exchange in circumstances where an erroneous trade has occurred in the underlying security.</p><p>If the counterparty to the trade does not agree to contra, the Market Supervision department will inform the counterparty if it is considering cancelling the trade(s). Within 60 minutes from the trade being executed the counterparty to the trade may provide to the Market Supervision department evidence that the price of the execution was correct. The Market Supervision department will then determine whether the trade(s) should be cancelled.</p><p>Member firms are reminded that they may only request an Exchange enforced cancellation for a trade in one of these instruments where the trade meets the criteria as set out above. Any subsequent trade as a result of the original trade will only be considered for Exchange enforced cancellation if it was executed on the order book.</p><p>Additional criteria for automated executions in gilt-edged securities and fixed interest securities</p><p>In determining whether an automated trade in one of the above instruments qualifies for potential Exchange enforced cancellation, the Market Supervision department will also consider:</p><p>&#8226; the potential loss to the member firm requesting the Exchange enforced cancellation, based on an Exchange reference price. The Market Supervision department will only consider an Exchange enforced cancellation where the amount of loss is &#163;10,000 or more in relation to automated trades conducted in a single stock on the trading system and &#163;20,000 or more in relation to automated trades conducted in more than one stock on the trading system; and</p><p>&#8226; whether any information requested by the Market Supervision department is complete, accurate and provided promptly. The Market Supervision department will determine what information it requires from member firms on a case by case basis.</p><p>The Exchange&#8217;s handling of Exchange enforced cancellations for trades executed before 16.30 hours</p><p>This guidance applies to trades executed before 16:30 hours including uncrossing trades from automatic execution suspension periods.</p><p>When the Exchange decides to cancel a trade it will aim to effect this, where practicable, within one hour of the trade time. At the latest the Exchange will endeavour to do this before the start of the mandatory period on the next business day. The Exchange will inform the market of its decision to cancel a trade via a Stock Exchange Notice.</p><p>The Exchange&#8217;s handling of Exchange enforced cancellations for the uncrossing of closing auctions concluding after 16.30 hours</p><p>When the Exchange is considering cancelling the uncrossing of a closing auction that concludes after 16.30 hours, it will endeavour to inform the market via RNS by 17.15 hours. Should the Exchange decide to cancel the uncrossing and restate the closing price, it will aim to inform the market of this decision and the new closing price via a Stock Exchange Notice by 17.30 hours. Should the Exchange decide not to restate the closing price it will aim to inform the market via RNS by 17.30 hours.</p><p>(Amended N06/19 &#8211; effective 18 March 2019)</p><table><tr><td><p></p></td><td><p>2121</p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>An appropriate market maker may be required from time to time to assist the Exchange by providing a theoretical price of a covered warrant, investment certificate or a leverage certificate in circumstances where the Exchange is asked to consider cancelling a trade in one of these instruments.</p></td></tr></table>","NativeContent":null,"ParentPartVersionId":1180131,"ParentPartSourceId":"a3f79853-aca7-4493-91ec-92b310a58265","ParentPartVersionOrdinal":1},{"LegislationVersionId":21794,"LegislationSourceId":"8a598c40-d3f3-11e8-8efb-484d7ee15899","LegislationVersionOrdinal":1,"Title":"Rules of the london stock exchange","NativeTitle":null,"JurisdictionSourceId":"6bd90564-8335-4f44-a449-b8e82eaafa5b","JurisdictionName":"United Kingdom","IssuingBodySourceId":"475a29ea-3918-4bb9-9014-82082606a68b","IssuingBodyName":"London Stock Exchange","PartVersionId":1180040,"PartSourceId":"e4cc5cbe-08a1-48c7-8534-269f25ba5938","PartVersionOrdinal":1,"OrderNum":3,"Content":"<table><tr><td><p>G</p></td><td><p>2122</p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>A member firm may allow a customer direct electronic access to the trading system under the member firm&#8217;s trading codes, either by way of direct market access or by providing sponsored access, subject to the member firm having in place adequate systems and controls.</p></td></tr></table><p>Guidance to Rule:</p><p>Direct market access and sponsored access</p><p>Submission of customer orders may be facilitated by either direct market access or via a sponsored access to the trading system.</p><p>Direct market access is a service through which a member firm allows a customer to submit orders to the trading system under the member firm&#8217;s trading codes and via the member firm&#8217;s order management systems, but without manual intervention by the member firm. These order management systems may be housed within the member firm&#8217;s facilities or hosted within the Exchange&#8217;s Primary Data Centre. A member firm must notify the Exchange via the Member Portal prior to implementing a direct market access service for its customers or when a member firm discontinues providing such a service for its customers. Note that a member firm is not required to notify the Exchange separately each time it offers direct market access to a new customer.</p><p>Sponsored access is a direct technical connection provided so that a customer is able to access the trading system under a sponsoring member firm&#8217;s trading codes.

All orders submitted via sponsored access will pass through the Exchange level controls before reaching the order book.</p><p>Responsibility for customers&#8217; order flow (whether submitted to the Exchange via direct market access or sponsored access)</p><p>Member firms providing customers with direct market access or sponsored access to the trading system are responsible for all obligations and liabilities arising from the entry, deletion and execution of all orders submitted by that customer.</p><p>The Exchange is aware that member firms may have contractual arrangements with their customers that mean the customer bears the financial risks of entering erroneous orders. However, under the Exchange&#8217;s Rules the responsibility for such orders rests wholly with the member firm under whose trading codes the order is entered.</p><p>The Exchange requires a member firm providing direct market access to be able to delete a customer&#8217;s orders from the trading system.</p><p>Member firms providing sponsored access may contact the Market Supervision department to delete a customer&#8217;s orders from the trading system following the guidance set out under rule 1500. Where the number of individual order deletions exceeds five, a mass order deletion is required. As the Market Supervision department actions such requests using reasonable endeavours, member firms should consider utilising the proactive kill switch to delete orders immediately where a mass order deletion is necessary.</p><p>Member firms must be able to restrict a customer&#8217;s ability to submit orders to the trading system.</p><p>Member firms must have the ability to delete a customer&#8217;s orders or restrict their ability to submit orders to the trading system without having the express consent of the customer. These actions may be instigated unilaterally by the member firm because of its own concerns regarding the customer&#8217;s behaviour or at the specific instruction of the Exchange.</p><p>The member firm is expected to adopt a regime where sufficient consideration is given to assess matters such as:</p><p>&#8226; the training that has been given to the individuals entering orders;</p><p>&#8226; the access controls over order entry that the customer applies;</p><p>&#8226; security controls over any network link between the customer and the member firm. These should be sufficient such that the member firm can be sure that an order purporting to come from a customer actually has done so (e.g. by use of authentication codes in a similar manner to the secure interactive interface linking the member firm to the Exchange); and</p><p>&#8226; clear allocation of responsibility for dealing with actions and errors (e.g. it should be clear how, when and by whom orders on the book would be deleted).</p><p>All of these matters should be dealt with in formal agreements between the member firm providing direct market access or sponsored access and its customer.</p><p>Direct market access</p><p>Whilst ongoing education, training and guidance for a member firm&#8217;s customers that submit orders through the member firm to the trading system are to be encouraged, these cannot entirely replace the safeguards that internal system controls and alerting functionality can provide.</p><p>In order to prevent the submission of erroneous orders by a customer, a member firm should implement the following controls and system alerts:</p><p>&#8226; prevention of submission of an order if the customer has overridden alerts and/or notification to the member firm that the customer has attempted to override the alert;</p><p>&#8226; the segregation of this order flow by the use of the Trader Group facility within the trading system;</p><p>&#8226; appropriate training, education and guidance provided to those customers entering orders;</p><p>&#8226; controls over maximum order sizes that can be submitted by different customers;</p><p>&#8226; controls over prices of orders and having system parameters that would generate an alert if the order would execute at a price with which the member firm would not be satisfied;</p><p>&#8226; monitoring and controls over the total exposure of the member firm to orders submitted for a particular customer; and</p><p>&#8226; the utilisation of a proactive kill switch facility to disconnect a customer which it has reason to believe is behaving inappropriately.</p><p>Sponsored access</p><p>The Exchange does not require sponsored access order flow to pass through the member firm&#8217;s own system controls but mandates that all orders submitted via sponsored access will pass through Exchange level controls before reaching the order book. Member firms should also assess whether any additional controls are necessary to appropriately manage customer order flow, taking into consideration the nature and complexity of its customer&#8217;s business.</p><p>Member firms are responsible for determining the limits of the configurable Exchange level controls within the parameters provided by the Exchange and ensuring that they are appropriate for each individual sponsored access customer, based on the scope and scale of its business.</p><p>A member firm that provides this facility for a customer must:</p><p>&#8226; complete a sponsored access application form for each of its sponsored access customers and inform the Exchange if it becomes aware that the information provided on the form has changed;</p><p>&#8226; ensure that relevant staff at the customer are conversant with the Rules and, in particular, those relating to order book trading. Relevant staff include the Head of Trading, the Head of Compliance and person(s) who signs off trading algorithms at the customer;</p><p>&#8226; segregate each customer&#8217;s order flow from the member firm&#8217;s order flow using the Trader Group facility within the trading system.

The AIM secondary market registered organisation must implement practical operational mechanisms (to be approved by the Exchange) to provide real time trading information to the Exchange on a continuous basis, in respect of transactions in AIM securities reported to the AIM secondary market registered organisation. These arrangements may vary from case to case, but must include information that will enable the Exchange, in relation to trading in AIM securities, to:</p><p>&#8226; see all executed trades immediately, including any unpublished trades;</p><p>&#8226; identify both counterparties to the trades; and</p><p>&#8226; identify through its surveillance system whether any anomalous trades or unusual trading is taking place on the AIM secondary market registered organisation.</p><p>The above information is required in order that the Exchange can ensure a proper market in AIM securities. Any material failure to meet these criteria will result in the Exchange withdrawing AIM secondary market registered organisation status with immediate effect.</p><p>The Exchange maintains a list of the approved AIM primary market registered organisations and AIM secondary market registered organisations on its website.</p><p>General Exclusions</p><p>The following trades would not be considered to be on Exchange:</p><p>&#8226; The creation and redemption of Exchange Traded Funds (unless bringing on Exchange for stamp relief reasons in which case such trades can be reported as non publishing trade reports).</p><p>In addition a contract to place, offer or underwrite securities that are the subject of an application to be admitted to trading, or admitted to trading on a venue where the contract is made before the application is accepted.</p><p>Primary allocations subject to listing are off Exchange.</p><p>An exception to this is the exercise of an over-allotment option (&#8220;green shoe&#8221;) which is commonly agreed by a sponsoring member firm as part of the stabilisation and underwriting arrangements for an introduction to admission to trading, as well as for further new issues of shares. Whether the option is ever exercised, and the extent to which it is utilised, will depend on the take up of the issue, the underlying share price in the market and the stabilisation transactions undertaken. Such trades can be brought on Exchange under the following circumstances:</p><p>&#8226; the terms of the green shoe option must be agreed and included in the circular, prospectus or an AIM admission document, where such documentation is required by law or is voluntarily published, prior to sign-off, including confirmation that the option writer holds sufficient shares to meet any obligation under the option;</p><p>&#8226; that at the point of exercise the shares to be delivered are admitted to trading; and</p><p>&#8226; a regulatory news announcement has disclosed that exercise has taken place.</p><p>Once the shares have been admitted to trading, and if all the above points have been met, the exercise of the green shoe option may be trade reported to the Exchange immediately after the agreement to exercise.

The absence of a trade report therefore means either:</p><p>1. the trade is an&quot;off Exchange&quot;trade; or</p><p>2. where there is other supporting evidence that a trade was intended to be on Exchange, a breach of the Exchange&#8217;s trade reporting responsibility rules.</p><p>On Exchange principal crosses, riskless principal trades and matched principal transactions, where there are distinct market and client side contracts, require distinct trade reports if all legs are to be brought on Exchange.</p><p>On Exchange agency crosses, where there is only one contract, require a single trade report.</p><p>For the purposes of this rule, a trade is considered concluded or executed as soon as:</p><p>(a) the terms of the trade with regard to the price and volume are agreed between the buyer and the seller; or</p><p>(b) where a trade includes multiple legs and where an agreement on the terms of each of the legs is a pre-condition to the completion of the trade, the trade is completed when all the legs have been put in place and agreed.</p><p>Erroneous trade reports</p><p>Member firms who consistently override the TRADEcho price and size validity check are expected to be able to provide on request, details of what alternative systems and controls they have in place to prevent the submission of erroneous trade reports.</p><p>Where the Exchange identifies a member firm consistently sending in erroneous trade reports, which could have been identified by the TRADEcho price and size validity check and the member firm has chosen to override this check on a systematic basis, the Exchange would consider this as evidence that the member firm did not have adequate systems and controls in accordance with rule 1020.</p><p>(Amended N09/17 &#8211; effective 3 January 2018)</p><table><tr><td><p>G</p></td><td><p>3011</p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>An on Exchange trade report must not duplicate another trade report in respect of the same execution unless it is being brought on Exchange as part of a riskless principal trade, a volume weighted average price trade, or a matched principal transaction and is marked appropriately.</p></td></tr></table><p>Guidance to Rule:</p><p>A member firm should not submit a publishing trade report where one has already been submitted to the Exchange.

Typically the member firm in the middle has visibility of both trades and is therefore principally responsible for ensuring that there is no duplicate publication (either within a single venue or across multiple venues).</p><p>This may require the middle member firm (and all others) to engage in dialogue with its counterparties about publication intentions &#8211; member firms should already be fully engaged on reporting intentions.</p><p>As a general principle the Exchange suggests that the &apos;market&apos; facing leg(s) should be published and the &apos;client&apos; facing leg(s) should not be published irrespective of which legs are on Exchange or off Exchange. In the absence of an overt &apos;market&apos; facing leg(s) and &apos;client&apos; facing leg(s), the member firm in the middle is best placed to determine which leg should be published, though this conclusion should be agreed with all parties involved who have a potential publication obligation under the Exchange&#8217;s rules or otherwise.</p><p>To illustrate this, the following riskless principal, matched principal transaction or principal cross scenarios could arise:</p><p>&#8226; if both legs are on Exchange, then publishing &apos;market&apos; trade report and non-publishing &apos;client&apos; trade report</p><p>&#8226; if one leg is on Exchange, then either publishing &apos;market&apos; trade report where the off Exchange leg is not published; or non-publishing &apos;client&apos; trade report where the off Exchange leg is published</p><p>&#8226; if neither leg is on Exchange, then no trade reports.</p><p>(Amended N09/17 &#8211; effective 3 January 2018</p><p>Responsibility for submission of a trade report</p><table><tr><td><p>G P</p></td><td><p>3012</p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>The following trade reporting responsibility rules apply, unless otherwise agreed in accordance with rule 3013:</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3012.1</p></td><td><p>a trade between a member firm and a non-member, the member firm reports;</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3012.2</p></td><td><p>a trade between a market maker and a broker dealer, the market maker reports;</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3012.3</p></td><td><p>a trade between two market makers, the selling market maker reports; and</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3012.4</p></td><td><p>a trade between two broker dealers, the selling broker dealer reports.</p></td></tr></table><p>Guidance to Rule:</p><p>Rule 3012.1</p><p>This would include an agency cross where the orders are matched by the member firm.</p><p>Rules 3012.2&amp;3012.3</p><p>For the purposes of determining the obligation to submit a trade report, a market maker in one subset of securities as defined in the parameters (e.g. Equity Main Market, AIM etc) shall be regarded as a market maker in all securities within that subset.</p><p>(Amended N09/17 &#8211; effective 3 January 2018)</p><table><tr><td><p>G</p></td><td><p>3013</p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p>In relation to rule 3012, where two member firms agree at or prior to the time of the trade, the responsibility for trade reporting may be delegated to the other member firm.</p></td></tr></table><p>Guidance to Rule:</p><p>The rule recognises that member firms may wish to delegate the trade reporting responsibility to the other member firm.

In appropriate cases (including where a greater sanction than the Executive Panel is authorised to impose is deemed appropriate by the Executive Panel), the Executive Panel may refer the case to the Disciplinary Committee.</p><p>There are a number of factors which the Exchange takes into account when considering what disciplinary action to take in relation to a rule breach. These are set out below:</p><p>&#8226; The seriousness, size and nature of the rule breach</p><p>&#8226; How the rule breach came to light</p><p>&#8226; The actual or potential market impact of the rule breach, and any other repercussions</p><p>&#8226; The extent to which the rule breach was deliberate or reckless</p><p>&#8226; The general compliance history of the member firm, and specific history regarding the rule breach in question</p><p>&#8226; Consistent and fair application of the rules (any precedents of previous similar rule breaches)</p><p>&#8226; The responsiveness and conduct of the member firm in relation to the matter under investigation.</p><p>The Exchange&#8217;s approach to regulation is aimed at maintaining the integrity, orderliness, transparency and good reputation of its markets and changing member firms&#8217; behaviour in those markets where necessary. The Exchange will investigate the facts of each case, seeking to understand why the rule breach occurred and will assess whether any remedial action the member firm has taken is adequate to prevent similar future occurrence.</p><p>The Executive Panel is a panel comprised of appropriately experienced senior members of the Exchange&apos;s staff. The procedures followed by the Executive Panel are set out in rules C200 to C290. The Executive Panel also considers appeals against fixed penalties. Any final decision of the Executive Panel (other than a decision to refer a matter to the Disciplinary Committee) may be appealed to the Appeals Committee. There is no appeal on interim decisions.</p><p>The Disciplinary Committee is drawn from a pool of appropriately experienced (non-Exchange) persons and its procedures are set out in rules C300 to C390.
