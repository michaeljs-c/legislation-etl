Shared Authentication Functionality-The method used to verify the credentials established by a person in connection with the use of the Access Device or a Digital Wallet on the Access Device also is the method used as the default CDCVM for Transactions involving Accounts accessed by means of the Access Device.</p><p>2. CVM Result Based on Authentication and Explicit Consent-The Payment Application on the Access Device analyzes the combined result of authentication and consent actions and sets the CDCVM results accordingly. Both Cardholder authentication and explicit Cardholder consent must occur before the Payment Application will complete a Transaction, as follows:</p><p>a. Cardholder authentication-The Cardholder may be prompted by the Access Device to perform the CDCVM action at the time of the Transaction, or the CDCVM may consist of a persistent authentication or prolonged authentication in which the CDCVM action is initiated and may also be completed before the Transaction occurs, as described in sections 3.11.3 and 3.11.4.</p><p>b. Explicit Cardholder consent-The Cardholder takes a specific Issuer-approved action that serves to confirm that the Cardholder intends a Transaction to be performed. This must consist of an action involving the Access Device that is separate from the act of tapping the Access Device to the Merchant&apos;s POS Terminal; for example, the clicking of a button.</p><p>3. Connected Consumer Devices-If two or more devices in the control of a Cardholder are able to be connected or linked to provide common payment functionality, so that each such device can be an Access Device for the same Account, then Cardholder consent must occur on the Access Device used to effect the Transaction.</p><p>4. Device Integrity-Upon initiation and continuing throughout Cardholder authentication, the use of the CDCVM must depend on strong device integrity checks. Examples include device runtime integrity checks, remote device attestation, or a combination of both, and checks to ensure that prolonged CVM velocity is intact; for example, the device lock functionality was not disabled.</p><p>CDCVM functionality requirements relating to explicit Cardholder consent apply only to the extent that a CVM is requested by the Merchant or Terminal or required by the Issuer for completion of a Transaction. A Cardholder may be offered the option to suppress CDCVM functionality relating to both Cardholder authentication and explicit Cardholder consent solely in connection with Contactless Transactions conducted to obtain transit access (for example, at a turnstile or entry gate).

Prior to the commencement of such PFI&apos;s investigation, the Customer must notify Mastercard of the proposed scope and nature of the investigation and obtain preliminary approval of such proposal by Mastercard or, if such preliminary approval is not obtained, of a modified proposal acceptable to Mastercard.

In connection with the independent forensic investigation and preparation of the final forensic report, no Customer may engage in or enter into (or permit an Agent to engage in or enter into) any conduct, agreement, or understanding that would impair the completeness, accuracy, or objectivity of any aspect of the forensic investigation or final forensic report. The Customer shall not engage in any conduct (or permit an Agent to engage in any conduct) that could or would influence, or undermine the independence of, the PFI or undermine the reliability or integrity of the forensic investigation or final forensic report. By way of example, and not limitation, a Customer must not itself, or permit any of its Agents to, take any action or fail to take any action that would have the effect of:</p><p>1. precluding, prohibiting, or inhibiting the PFI from communicating directly with Mastercard;</p><p>2. permitting a Customer or its Agent to substantively edit or otherwise alter the forensic report; or</p><p>3. directing the PFI to withhold information from Mastercard.</p><p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mastercard may engage a PFI on behalf of the Customer in order to expedite the investigation.
